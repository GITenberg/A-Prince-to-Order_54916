<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Grey’s</span> awakening was as gradual as a
clouded dawn. For a time dreams
and realities intermingled. Then
slowly a partial consciousness of his
physical being obtruded: his fingers were
clutching a silken coverlet; he turned on his
side and the linen pillow-case was cool to his
cheek; through half-open eyelids a sweep of pale
blue became visible. Later he realised that he was
in a curtained bed and that the blue was the colour
of the draperies. He lay still for a long while—drowsy,
inert, his sensibilities numb. Presently
the ticking of a clock became audible, and then a
rumble of street sounds. At the same moment a
throbbing pain in his head asserted itself. With
an effort he sat up, his hands pressed against his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
temples, his mind groping. Then in a flash the
unfamiliarity of his surroundings aroused him
suddenly, sharply, like a cold plunge, and his brain
cleared a trifle. His memory went staggering
back after the night before; but the mists descended
again and the way grew dark, and he
could remember no night without its morning.</p>

<p>He put his feet to the floor and stood up, but a
dizziness overcame him, and he sank back
upon the bed, weak and limp. His heart was
beating tumultuously and his breath came in short,
quick gasps. After a little these abnormalities
passed and he raised himself on one elbow, resting
his cheek on his hand. At the contact he started,
amazed, bewildered. In some unaccountable manner
he had grown a beard. His hand ran from his
cheek to his chin. Close-cropped at the sides it
was here an inch long and trimmed to a point, and
his moustache was one of several months’ culture
and training. He fancied he was dreaming and
would awaken presently to find himself clean-shaven,
as he had been for years.</p>

<p>And now, he remembered; after all, it was quite
clear. He had been to the opera last night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
had gone from there to the club, had returned
home late, and, having a pressing business appointment
at ten this morning, had dragged himself
out of bed at eight, still fagged and aggravatingly
sleepy. Now he had just had his coffee, and
while Lutz was shaving him he was dozing and
dreaming.</p>

<p>But how wonderfully real the transformation
all seemed! He grew curious as to how he looked
with beard and moustache, and, crawling out between
the pale-blue velvet curtains, he sought a
mirror. The revelation was dumfounding. He,
Carey Grey, who from infancy had been as dark
as a Spaniard, was as blond as a Norseman. He
ran his fingers through his hair, tousled it, going
closer to the glass to make sure that there was not
some optical illusion. He puffed out his lip and
pulled at his moustache until his lowered eyes
could see it, and he thrust his chin forward and
turned up the point of his beard with the back of
his hand until it, too, came within the range of
his vision. If this were a dream, he told himself,
never before had dream been so real. If it were a
reality, never before had reality been so mystifying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
His puzzled survey of himself was followed by
a minute inspection of the room into which he had
been so mysteriously transported. Its general
aspect was foreign; its detail distinctly French.
The walls were panelled and medallioned. The
bed from which he had risen was one of a pair,
each with its gilded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papier mâché</i> frieze and its
looped-back blue velvet curtains. At the head of
each bed were six pillows and another of down at
the foot. The full-length mirror into which he
had gazed was duplicated between two windows.
Upon the mantel was a bronze and gilt clock,
flanked by partially burned candles in brass sticks.
Two tables, a couch, a washstand, a cheffonier,
three chairs and a wardrobe completed the furnishing.
A couple of companion pictures, unmistakably
French both in conception and execution,
decorated two of the wall panels. The hands of
the clock stood at twenty minutes of four. He
crossed to a window with three sets of curtains
and three sets of cord loops all of a tangle, and
looked out.</p>

<p>For the spectacle that confronted him he was
not prepared. The change in his appearance had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
indeed been incomprehensible; the strangeness of
the room in which he awakened was inexplicable;
but to discover at a glance that he was no longer
on his native soil, that without his knowledge
he had been carried across sea and land
and dropped into a Paris hotel on the Boulevard
des Italiens, was not only inconceivable but
terrifying. He was very pale, and his brain was
reeling. Twice he drew trembling fingers across
his eyes, as if to wipe out the kaleidoscope of the
street below; but when he looked again the view
was even more convincing. It was a bit of the
French Capital with which he was almost as familiar
as with that part of Fifth avenue lying within
range of his club windows or with that portion of
Broad street near Wall into which he had been
wont to glance from his office in the Mills Building.</p>

<p>He turned away from it as from a nightmare,
and, sitting down, tried to think. The idea that
he was dreaming was not tenable. He knew that
he was very wide awake and thoroughly possessed
of his faculties. His head still ached with a dull,
swollen, congested sensation such as follows a too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
riotous night, but he could recall nothing of the
cause. It occurred to him now that he had read
in the newspapers of cases where men had lost
their memory for months and had wandered into
remote states or countries. This must be the explanation.
And in his aberration he had given
way to some freak of fancy, had grown a beard
and then had had it and his hair bleached corn
colour. Men under similar mental derangement,
he recollected, forgot their names and homes.
Perhaps he had been in the same plight. Now,
however, his mind was clear on those points, at
least, and he thanked God for his restoration.</p>

<p>Then he wondered how long he had been away.
That night at the opera and the club; that morning
he had risen early to keep an engagement, and
had dozed off while his valet was shaving him—why,
that was midwinter; and now, if he could
judge by the trees on the boulevard, and the tables
in front of the Café Riche across the road, and the
straw hats, it must be early summer—late May or
June; possibly, indeed, July. And all this time
his friends at home—his mother, his fiancée, his
partner—were probably thinking him dead. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
a relief it would be to them to get the cablegrams
he would send, telling that he was alive and well
and was returning by the first steamer!</p>

<p>He smiled as he got up and went to the cheffonier
and the wardrobe in search of clothes. He
was thinking of the sensation the papers in New
York must have made over his disappearance; the
theories they must have advanced and the pictures
they must have published. And then the tragic
side of the affair took hold of him, and he put
himself in his mother’s place, in Hope’s place, and
fancied he could appreciate, in a way at least, their
anxiety as the days passed without tidings, and
their grief and despair as weeks quadrupled into
months.</p>

<p>Having discovered an assortment of garments,
including a bathrobe of pongee silk, he looked
about for a tub. Across the passage he found a
bathroom, and a dip into cold water relieved his
headache and balanced his nerves. When at length
he was in attire which, while quite as unfamiliar
as his yellow hair and beard, was nevertheless
tasteful and well fitting, he emerged from his
room, locked the door and started forth on a tour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of investigation. His curiosity had grown with
his dressing, enhanced, perhaps, by his failure to
find in any drawer, closet, or pocket a scrap of
writing or printing from which he could gain a
clue concerning his recent past. His sole discovery
indeed had been a wallet containing two fifty-franc
notes and a trunk key.</p>

<p>A tall, round-faced <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> in green livery
smiled and bowed, rather obsequiously he thought,
as he passed out through the wide portal into the
boulevard. Then the commingled scent of asphalt
and macadam and burning charcoal—that characteristically
Parisian odour—smote his olfactories,
and before his eyes was the afternoon panorama
of the gayest of Paris thoroughfares. It
was the newspaper hour, and a kiosk in front of
the hotel was being besieged by a horde, each hungry
for his favourite journal. Every man that
passed had a paper in his hand or in his pocket.
Some were reading as they walked. On the roadway
carriages, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiacres</i>, omnibuses were crowding,
and Grey noted, with a sense of old friends returned,
the varnished hats of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cochers</i>. The
chairs under the awnings of the cafés were filling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and the white-aproned waiters were coming and
going with their inevitable bustle of trays and
glasses.</p>

<p>At the corner of the rue St. Anne he crossed to
the north side of the boulevard and turned into the
rue Taitbout, in which, he remembered, there was
a telegraph office, for he meant to lose no time in
despatching his cables. As he picked his way
through the narrow street the messages took form,
and on reaching the office it was but the labour of
a moment to put them on paper, poke them in
through the little window and pay the stipulated
toll. To his mother he wired:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Safe and well. Sailing first steamer. Hôtel Grammont.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the others—one addressed to Hope Van
Tuyl, East Sixty-fourth street, New York, and
one to “Malgrey,” the code name of the stock
brokerage firm in which he was a junior partner—were
similar.</p>

<p>Rejoining the throng of pedestrians on the boulevard,
he sauntered leisurely towards the Avenue
de l’Opéra, his mind still busy with conjectures.</p>

<p>The billboards in front of the Théâtre du Vaudeville<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
caught his eye, but the attractions they announced
made no impression. At the groups
of idlers seated at little round tables before the
Café Américain he scarcely glanced and his own
unfamiliar reflection in the plate glass of the
shop windows he failed utterly to recognise. He
crossed the Place de l’Opéra without so much as
turning his head, and halting at the far corner
stepped in under the ample awning of the Café de
la Paix and found a seat. Of the waiter who
approached him he ordered a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mazagran</i> and some
Egyptian cigarettes, and when they were brought
he sat for some time, heedless of his surroundings,
his brain racked with futile speculations.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pardon, monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>Someone in passing had inadvertently touched
his foot and was apologising. Startled out of his
reverie he looked up, and his face lighted. Instantly
he was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Frothingham, by all that’s good!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The other, tall, straight and swarthy, turned
upon him a look in which mystification and suspicion
fought for supremacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
“Really,” he said, coldly, “I—I don’t remember
ever having——”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” Grey interrupted, not
without some embarrassment, “I can quite understand
that you shouldn’t recognise me. You see,
I—well, I’m Carey Grey.”</p>

<p>Mr. Frothingham’s demeanour showed no
change.</p>

<p>“Carey Grey,” he repeated, icily; “I used to
know a Carey Grey in New York, a member of
the Knickerbocker and the Union; but he was
nearly as dark as I am, and besides—why, he’s
dead.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind sitting down a bit,” Grey
went on, as he staggered under the news of his
own demise, “I’ll try to explain. I’m Carey Grey,
just the same—<em>the</em> Carey Grey, of the Knickerbocker
and the Union, and I’m not dead.”</p>

<p>Frothingham recognised his voice now, and
mystification routed suspicion from the field. He
took a chair and Grey sat down, too, with the
marble-topped table between them.</p>

<p>“First and foremost,” Grey began, “tell me
what day of the month it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
“The fourteenth.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Of June, of course.”</p>

<p>“And of the week?”</p>

<p>“Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I hadn’t the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>Frothingham fancied the man had gone mad.</p>

<p>“The whole thing is most extraordinary,” Grey
went on, and then he proceeded to relate his afternoon’s
experience, while his listener preserved an
interested but incredulous silence.</p>

<p>“Can’t remember a blessed thing,” the narrator
concluded, “since that morning last winter—I
suppose it was last winter. What year is this?”</p>

<p>He was told.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was last winter, then—January, if I’m
not mistaken.”</p>

<p>Frothingham looked thoughtful and counted
back. He wondered whether it was insanity or
drugs, or—cunning.</p>

<p>“You must have heard something of it,” Grey
went on, eagerly. “Did the newspapers say I was
dead?”</p>

<p>“I think that was the ultimate conclusion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
“I suppose they searched for me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they searched. They followed up
every clue. There were columns in the papers for
days—yes, for weeks.”</p>

<p>Grey sighed audibly.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he said, with something
of distress in his voice; “I never thought my head
was weak. To be sure, I’d been under rather a
strain, with the market in the unsettled condition
it was, but my memory was always clear enough.
Why, I could give you the closing price and
highest and lowest of about every active stock on
the list, day after day, without an error of an
eighth. By the way, do you know how things
have been going in the Street? What’s New York
Central now—and St. Paul?”</p>

<p>“Really, I have lost track, Grey,” replied Frothingham
indifferently.</p>

<p>“I must get a Paris <i>Herald</i>,” the man who had
been out of the world for five months continued;
“I’m the modern Rip Van Winkle. Thousands
of things have happened—must have happened,
and I’m in blank ignorance. I just cabled to New
York—to Mallory, my partner, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“You what!” exclaimed Frothingham, in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Cabled to Mallory. You know him—Dick
Mallory, my partner. He’ll be surprised to hear
I’m alive, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Good God, man!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>The two sat staring at each other across the
table, each a picture of sudden startled bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Then you really don’t know?” Frothingham
asked. “Oh, that’s impossible! You can’t make
me believe—see here, Carey, you’re very clever
and all that, but you don’t think for one minute,
do you, that you are taking me in? I did fancy
for a little while that you’d gone off your head;
but I was wrong. You’re sharp and shrewd, and
you feared I had recognised you and that that was
why I stumbled over your foot; so you made up
your mind that you’d block my game by recognising
me and telling me this pipe dream. Oh, come,
come, be fair! You know; and you know that I
know.”</p>

<p>Grey caught his breath sharply as this torrent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of insult surged upon him. The blood rushed to
his face only to desert it. His fists doubled instinctively,
and he rose to his feet, white with
indignant anger.</p>

<p>“Take that back!” he commanded, in a hoarse
whisper. “Take it back, I say, or I’ll——”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his earnestness, his determination;
no, nor at this juncture, his honesty.
Frothingham was convinced even against his
judgment.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say,” he retorted, mildly, “don’t make
a scene, old chap. If I said anything, I—I—well,
of course you don’t understand. I see it now.
I’m sure I was wrong, and I ask your pardon.
There now, sit down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I care to,” Grey replied, the
words of the other still rankling. “I’m not used
to being called a blackguard. I’ve never in my
life done anything to be seriously ashamed of, and
nobody has ever dared, until this day, to utter such
an insinuation.”</p>

<p>Frothingham was silent for a moment, the mere
suggestion of a smile on his lips. He calmly unbuttoned
one of his gloves and then buttoned it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
“God forbid,” he said, without looking up,
“that I should be the first to imply anything; but—I
wish you would sit down, Grey!—you say
you’ve lost count for five months, and—well, there
are some things that you ought to know.”</p>

<p>Grey resumed his seat. Now the man was talking
reasonably. Of course there were things that
he ought to know—hundreds of things probably
in which he was personally interested. The
thought instantly became appalling. What, indeed,
might not have happened in five months?
Where had he been during that time? And what
had he been doing?</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted, “you are quite right, I
suppose. One of the things, for instance, is——”</p>

<p>“One of the things, for instance, is,” repeated
the other, interrupting him, “that you left New
York suddenly—disappeared totally and—you
ought to know this for your own salvation—under
a cloud.”</p>

<p>Grey started, and the colour that had returned
to his face fled again. He leaned across the table,
resting his arms on its marble top.</p>

<p>“Under a cloud!” he exclaimed, breathlessly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
“My God, Frothingham! What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not go into details,” was the answer,
given very quietly. “It’s not a pleasant position
that I have chosen for myself, and I prefer that
you don’t question me. What you have told me—and
I’m satisfied now it is the truth—has put
another light on the whole business. And you
really cabled to New York?”</p>

<p>“Not half an hour ago. I sent three.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late, I suppose, to stop them.”</p>

<p>“I fancy so.”</p>

<p>“I’d see, if I were you. It is important.”</p>

<p>“But why? For God’s sake, man, tell me
why.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frothingham, rising; “you’d better
read about it for yourself. It will be more satisfactory.
You can find a file of the New York
<i>Herald</i> at the office of the Paris paper. It’s only
a block or so away, you know. Look up last January.
But I’d try to stop those cables first. I
must be off now; I’ve got an appointment.” And
he joined the now much augmented throng on the
promenade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Grey dropped a five-franc piece on the table, and
hurried into a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiacre</i> that stood in waiting.</p>

<p>“Rue Taitbout, 46,” he directed.</p>

<p>But when he reached there it was to learn that
his messages had been dispatched and that no
power on earth could recall them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Consumed</span> with eager concern, Grey
had himself driven to the office of the
<i>Herald</i>. He was perturbed, distraught,
and nervously apprehensive.</p>

<p>“Under a cloud,” he repeated, thoughtfully;
“under a cloud. That may mean anything—murder,
arson, theft, elopement. I’m a fugitive
from justice, I suppose. That much Frothingham
made very clear when he urged my
stopping those cables.” And then his mood
changed, and he argued that he was unnecessarily
agitated. It could not be so bad. In his senses
or out of them he would never, he felt sure, have
committed a crime—some indiscretion, possibly,
but not a crime.</p>

<p>When at length the file of the newspaper was
before him and he was turning the pages, he noted
that his fingers were unsteady and that perspiration
was oozing from every pore. Carefully he scanned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
each headline, running down column after column
with keen scrutiny. Ten minutes passed and
he had reached nearly the middle of the month
without finding so much as a line of what he
sought. Much of the matter, however, was familiar,
from which he argued that the date of revelation
must be farther on. Each leaf of the book of
days he turned now with dread expectation. He
had been standing, the file on a table at arm’s
length, but suddenly he sat down, stunned by the
message of the types that faced him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Carey Grey an Embezzler—Well-known
Wall Street Broker Hypothecates Firm’s
Securities and Disappears—Upwards of a
Hundred Thousand Dollars Gone.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>His heart was pounding very hard and his head
was bursting.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie,” he muttered, inaudibly, “an outrageous,
despicable lie. It’s impossible. It’s preposterous.
Embezzle from my own firm? It’s
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and pulled the file of papers
down until one end rested in his lap, and then he
read hastily, but with the scrupulous heed of absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
concentration, every word of the two columns
that told with minute detail the story of his defalcation
and flight.</p>

<p>“Carey Grey, of the firm of Mallory &amp; Grey,
stockbrokers, with offices in the Mills Building,”
began the account, “has been missing for a week
and securities to the value of $110,000, it was discovered
yesterday, have disappeared from the
firm’s safe deposit vault. Most of the securities,
including first mortgage bonds of the Chicago &amp;
Northwestern Railroad Company, to the amount
of $40,000, and Brooklyn Rapid Transit 5s, worth
$40,000 more, Grey hypothecated, personally, with
the Shoe and Leather Bank on the day prior to
his flight.</p>

<p>“The news of the defalcation caused a sensation
in the Street and in society as well. Carey
Grey was one of the most popular members of the
Stock Exchange and his character had always
been regarded as beyond reproach. A member of
an old New York family—his mother was a Livingstone—his
social position was of the best. He
occupied bachelor apartments in the Dunscombe,
on Sixty-sixth street, near Madison avenue, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
his name appears on the membership lists of the
Union, Knickerbocker, and other clubs.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mallory, his partner, said yesterday:
‘Mr. Grey was at his desk last Wednesday when
I reached the office, and he was there when I went
away at half-past three. There was nothing unusual
in his manner. He discussed with me several
matters of business and spoke of a certain
directors’ meeting that he should attend the next
day. I have not seen or heard from him since.
When he did not appear on Thursday I feared he
was ill and telephoned to his rooms, but the answer
came that he was not in. The whole business
is to me inexplicable. I have known Carey Grey
from childhood, and I would have been willing
to swear that there was not a dishonest bone in
his body. But the evidence against him is simply
indisputable. The loss struck us at an especially
bad time, but we shall pull through all right.’</p>

<p>“Inspector McClusky admitted that he was all
at sea concerning Grey’s whereabouts. The case
was not reported to him for a week—not until the
securities were missed—and so it was quite possible
the absconder had left the country; nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
he was doing all in his power to locate
him.</p>

<p>“At Grey’s apartments yesterday Franz Lutz,
his valet, was preparing to seek employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Grey,’ he said, ‘slept here last Wednesday
night. He rose about eight o’clock Thursday
morning, saying he had an urgent business appointment
at the Waldorf-Astoria at ten sharp.
He went away in a cab, and I have not seen him
since.’</p>

<p>“Grey’s mother, who lives with her sister, Mrs.
Hermann Valkenburgh, in Washington Square,
North, has been prostrated by the revelations of
the past twenty-four hours, and is under the care
of her physician, Dr. Elbridge Bond.</p>

<p>“A rumour that Grey was engaged to be married
to Miss Hope Van Tuyl, daughter of Nicholas
Van Tuyl, president of the Consolidated Mortgage
Company, was current yesterday. Miss Van
Tuyl when seen last night denied the report.”</p>

<p>There was more of it, much more, all of which
Grey read with deep and astonished interest; but
it was merely repetition and speculation. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
he finished the two columns he turned to the paper
of the day following, and found a column there.
As Frothingham had told him, the newspapers
had kept up the sensation for weeks, and the
<i>Herald</i> was as energetic as any. At length came
a report that a man answering his description had
jumped overboard from a steamer in the Gulf of
Mexico and had been drowned before assistance
could reach him. There was nothing in his effects
to give a hint as to his identity, but the world,
with one accord, apparently, had accepted the suggestion
that it was the missing Grey, and then the
subject was dropped.</p>

<p>He ran through the files for another month, but
other matters of more immediate interest had
crowded the Grey affair out of the public thought.</p>

<p>He returned the papers to the clerk who had
provided them, and went out onto the Avenue de
l’Opéra, horrified and perplexed. He was a felon,
hiding from the law. And yet never, so far as
he could remember, had he harboured a dishonest
impulse. He was disguised to escape detection,
and the disguise when he had discovered it had
been, and still was, more mystifying to himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
than it could possibly be to others. Then he began
to wonder what his cables would bring forth. He
would be arrested, of course, and tried, and in all
probability found guilty. The evidence against
him as set forth in the newspaper account was not
merely strong—it was irrefutable. Against the
testimony of Mallory and of the bank officials
what could he offer in refutation? To fancy any
court or jury would put faith in his asseveration
that he was unconscious when the act was committed
was to count on the impossible. Nevertheless
it was clearly his duty now to return at once
to America and do all in his power to make reparation.
And then it occurred to him that in spite
of his alleged embezzlement he was, apparently,
practically without funds. If he had taken the
money, as charged, it must, of course, be somewhere,
but of its location he had not the faintest
idea. That he had disposed of a hundred or even
eighty thousand dollars in five months was in the
highest degree improbable.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Rue de la Paix is the office
of Thomas Cook &amp; Sons, and Grey entered and
inquired as to the sailing of transatlantic liners.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The <i>Celtic</i>, he learned, was to sail the next day
from Liverpool, but he could make better time
probably, the clerk told him, by taking the
<i>Deutschland</i> from Boulogne, or the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse</i> from Cherbourg, on Saturday.
The tide of travel was all the other way at this
season and he would have no difficulty in securing
a stateroom, even at the last minute.</p>

<p>Resuming his stroll he had very nearly reached
his hotel when a young man, pale and evidently
much agitated, halted before him, and raising his
hat, deferentially, said:</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, Herr Arndt, but I beg
you to make haste. Herr Schlippenbach—he is
dying.”</p>

<p>He spoke in German, and Grey noted that in
feature and manner he was Teutonic. For an
instant the American imagined the youth had addressed
him by mistake, but he had sufficient presence
of mind to give no sign. A second later he
was reassured.</p>

<p>“I went to your room, Herr Arndt, as usual at
four-thirty, but you were gone out, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>
told me you left no message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Grey hesitated over a reply. He realized that
he was on the verge of a discovery. It was very
evident now that he was not alone in Paris—that
he had acquaintances, at least; probably companions;
and that one of them was dying. In
order to learn more he must give no indication
of the change that had been wrought in him in the
last few hours.</p>

<p>“Dying!” he exclaimed, in a tone of surprise;
“I had no idea it was so serious.”</p>

<p>His German was excellent. In his early youth
he had spent two years at Göttingen, and
had lived for one winter with a German family in
Vienna.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the young man, excitedly, “the
Herr Doctor says it is a matter now of hours only,
perhaps minutes. They have sent for a priest.
Herr Schlippenbach—poor old Herr Schlippenbach—he
is quite unconscious.”</p>

<p>“He can recognise no one?”</p>

<p>“No, Herr Arndt, he just lies staring at the
ceiling, and breathing very hard and loud. Oh, it
is so pitiful! And the Fräulein, she is sobbing,
sobbing, sobbing all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Herr Arndt.</i> So that is the name he is known
by here in Paris, at the Hôtel Grammont, by those
he has met—those he has travelled with, perhaps!
And there is a Fräulein in the party! Herr Schlippenbach’s
daughter, probably. A hundred questions
crowded for utterance, but he held them
back.</p>

<p>“It was the Fräulein who sent for the priest, I
suppose?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt; she and Herr Captain Lindenwald.
When Herr Schlippenbach dies Fräulein
von Altdorf will have a great fortune; yes?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” Grey hazarded. Then the girl was not
the old German’s daughter, after all, though she
was to inherit his property. The affair was growing
a trifle complicated.</p>

<p>“And Herr Captain Lindenwald—will he, do
you think, Herr Arndt, marry the Fräulein?”</p>

<p>Grey was silent. If this fellow was a servant
he was evidently forgetting his place, and it was
well to remind him of it.</p>

<p>“How odd it is I never can remember your
name!” he said, at length, ignoring the question
and scowling a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
“Johann, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, to be sure. How stupid!”</p>

<p>And then they turned in at the broad marble
entrance of the hotel.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> room into which Johann conducted
Grey was on the second floor, its windows
overlooking the court. With
the glare of the boulevards still in
their eyes, the gloom of the darkened chamber
was for a moment almost impenetrable. Grey
was conscious of the presence of several persons,
but they appeared more like shadows than
realities, their outlines alone distinguishable. The
room was very quiet, save for the sound of the
laboured breathing which Johann had mentioned,
and which came from a bed in an alcove to the
left of the entrance. Grey stood hesitant just inside
the doorway, while his vision grew accustomed
to the semi-darkness; and Johann, hat in
hand, stood behind him.</p>

<p>Presently from out of the dusk a figure approached,
tiptoeing across the floor.</p>

<p>“He is dying!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
The words were whispered in German. The
speaker, Grey observed, was of medium height,
but broad of shoulder and of erect military bearing.
The ends of his moustache were trained upward
after the fashion affected by the German
Emperor.</p>

<p>Grey nodded his head in token that he understood.</p>

<p>“Dr. Zagaie is here. He has just administered
nitro-glycerine and tincture of aconite. We are
hoping that he may regain consciousness.”</p>

<p>Objects were now becoming more clearly defined.
Grey could see the bed now, though its
occupant was hidden by the bulky form of the
physician, who had his fingers on the dying man’s
pulse, and by the black-clad, slender figure of a
woman who was pressing a handkerchief to her
eyes. At the foot of the bed stood a white-capped
and white-cuffed nurse.</p>

<p>“Let us hope,” Grey responded.</p>

<p>The situation was most trying. He was with
those who, it was apparent, knew him extremely
well, and yet were to him utter strangers. He was
almost afraid to speak lest he betray himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
if the necessity for learning something concerning
his associates and associations had not been so
urgently important he would have retreated without
waiting further developments. He was nervously
a-tremble, his fingers were twitching involuntarily
and alternately waves of hot and cold
bathed him from head to heel. The atmosphere
of the room stifled him; the stertorous breathing
of the invalid oppressed him, the gloom and the
whispers and the soft tread of the persons present
drove him frantic. He was seized with an almost
uncontrollable impulse to shout, to rush about, to
pull back the curtains and let in some daylight.
He gripped his hat until the brim cracked in his
hand, the sound cutting the silence discordantly.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Herr Arndt. We are expecting the
Reverend Father. I sent Lutz for him half an
hour ago.”</p>

<p><i>Lutz!</i> Had the dusk been less deep the surprise
that came over Grey’s features must have been observed.
Lutz! Could it be possible that his valet
was here in Paris with him, he asked himself.
And instantly he negatived the answer. Such a
supposition was beyond reason. He had misunderstood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
or it was another Lutz. The name was
not uncommon.</p>

<p>He placed his hat on a table and took a chair
near a window, from which he could look into the
court below. The man who had addressed him
joined the group at the bedside. Johann quietly
opened the door and went out, closing it as quietly
behind him. The silence became painful. The
inhalations and exhalations of the patient grew
less strident. The sobs of the Fraülein, which
had at intervals punctured the stillness, were suppressed.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, there was a commotion about
the bed. The dying man, who for hours had been
gazing fixedly at the ceiling, turned his eyes upon
his watchers and moved his head feebly. The
doctor beckoned the nurse.</p>

<p>“Raise his head and shoulders a trifle. Quick,
another pillow!”</p>

<p>Promptly and deftly the nurse obeyed.</p>

<p>“The stimulants are acting,” murmured the
Herr Captain to the Fraülein: “he has responded,
but it will be but temporary.”</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes with her wet handkerchief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
but said nothing. The invalid’s gaze passed each
of the four in turn. Then his lips moved, and the
doctor, bending down, placed his ear close to his
mouth.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Arndt,” the physician said, in a
low tone, as he straightened himself, “it is Monsieur
Arndt that he wants.”</p>

<p>The other three turned towards Grey. Captain
Lindenwald raised his hand with a beckoning gesture.</p>

<p>“He wants you,” he whispered; and as the
American approached the bed they made way for
him. It was a face very thin and drawn that met
Grey’s view. Very sallow, too, and parchment-like;
the nose long and peaked, and the under lip,
where it showed above the snow-white beard,
darkly purple. A great shock of hair vied with
the pillows in whiteness. In the tired eyes was a
look of recognition.</p>

<p>“Lean over,” said Dr. Zagaie; “he wishes to
speak to you. His voice is very weak.”</p>

<p>A sensation of repulsion had swept over Grey
at sight of the old man, and now, to bring his face
close to that of the invalid upon whom death had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
already set its mark was sickeningly repugnant.
But with an effort of will he bent his head. A
withered, wrinkled hand gripped his wrist and for
the hundredth part of a second he recoiled. The
voice that breathed into his ear was little more
than a sigh, and he strained to gather the
words.</p>

<p>“Take it,” he heard; “it is yours. The
key——”</p>

<p>And then the utterances sank so low as to be
unintelligible. That the old man had spoken in
English was a circumstance over which Grey
marvelled quite as much as he did over the ambiguous
command. He stood erect again and would
have stepped back, but the grip of the sufferer was
still upon his arm. Then, from the glazing eyes
came an appeal that was unmistakable, and again
Grey bent his ear.</p>

<p>“The throne,” breathed the voice feebly; “it
is yours. Take it!” This much the listener heard
quite clearly, mentally commenting that the
speaker was delirious. But from the sentences
that followed he could only glean a word here and
there. “Key” was mentioned again, and “box,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and he thought he heard “proofs,” and something
that sounded like “Gare du Nord.”</p>

<p>At length the fingers on his wrist relaxed and
the eyes of Herr Schlippenbach closed. Instantly
and with professional celerity Dr. Zagaie plunged
the needle of a hypodermic syringe into the fainting
man’s arm. Simultaneously there was a gentle
tap on the door, and without waiting to be
bidden a florid-faced priest entered, carrying a
small black leather case.</p>

<p>Grey resumed his place by the window, his brain
teeming with problems so enigmatical as to defy
even theoretical solution. The dying man was
delirious, of course, he argued; therefore his
words were unworthy of consideration. And yet,
he answered himself, he had made a supreme effort
to convey a message and he had chosen to phrase
it in not his own tongue but his listener’s, to make
sure that it would be understood. He felt like a
man in a maze. At every turn there was some
new surprise; and he was going on and on, getting
farther and farther into the tangle, without as yet
seeing any chance of extricating himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unnoticed by him, preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the Sacrament of Extreme Unction were being
hurriedly made. The priest had donned his alb
and stole and poured from a cruet the holy oil.
The next minute the voice of the cleric, clear and
distinct, cleaving the hush of the room, startled
Grey from his meditation. The droning of the
Latin ritual, solemn and awesome, struck a new
chord in his emotional being. He got to his feet
and stood with clasped hands and bowed head.
Now the priest was anointing the dying man’s
eyes. With oily thumb he made the sign of the
cross and recited the words: “Through this holy
unction, and His most blessed mercy, may the
Lord pardon thee whatever sins thou hast committed
by thy sight, Amen.” And then his ears,
his nose, his mouth, his hands, his feet were each
in turn anointed with the same form of supplication.</p>

<p>The ceremony concluded, Dr. Zagaie again
stepped forward, taking the place vacated by the
priest. As he did so Herr Schlippenbach, who
had been breathing softly, peacefully, with closed
lids, opened his eyes wide with a look of sudden
horror. There was a quick, convulsive movement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that stirred the coverlet, a long deep-drawn sigh,
and the aged man lay motionless.</p>

<p>Fraülein von Altdorf turned away, grief-stricken
and horrified, from the spectacle of death,
and Grey for the first time saw her face. It was
more than pretty, he thought, with its big, sad
blue eyes and its full, red-lipped mouth all a-quiver
with emotion. And her hair, which shone even
in the dusk of that darkened apartment with a
lustre of its own imparting, was very abundant
and very beautiful. He realised that she was coming
towards him and he took a step forward to
meet her. She raised her arms and stretched out
her hands gropingly until they rested on his shoulders,
and instinctively he knew that she had grown
suddenly faint. He clasped her swaying figure
about the waist and supported her to a couch.</p>

<p>“Dr. Zagaie,” he called, impatiently, “Mlle.
von Altdorf requires a restorative.”</p>

<p>Captain Lindenwald, who had been speaking to
the nurse, turned solicitously at the words.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he cried, kneeling beside the prostrate
girl, “my dear, let me get you some wine;
the strain has been too much for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
But the Fräulein motioned him away.</p>

<p>“I shall be quite myself presently,” she said.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Dr. Zagaie insisted on her taking
a sedative.</p>

<p>After a little Grey withdrew, and not without
some difficulty found his apartment, which was
on the same floor, but in another part of the hotel.
In his absence his room had been put in order, and
there now lay upon the table a blue envelope, addressed
in a distinctly English hand to “M. Max
Arndt.” Though it was undoubtedly meant for
him it was with rather a sense of impropriety that
he took it up and tore off the end. Revelation
after revelation had followed one another so rapidly
that afternoon that he was growing callous
to discovery, and when he <span class="locked">read—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Max</span>:
</p>

<p>I shall be unable to dine with you tonight as I promised,
but will meet you later in the Café Américain if you
can arrange it—say between eleven and midnight. <span class="smcap">Jack.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">—it was with scarcely a tremour of surprise. Indeed
there was something in the tone of the scrawl—something,
perhaps, in the penmanship, that
gave him a sense of reassurance. The dying Herr
Schlippenbach had affected him oddly. Nearness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
to him had produced a sort of emotional nausea,
and for some reason which he could not explain
he had experienced a violent antipathy to Captain
Lindenwald. He realized that, surrounding the
little company of which he had so strangely found
himself one, there was a mystery which baffled his
understanding. Then the last words of the old
German recurred to him, and again he pondered
as to whether they bore any significance or were
merely the murmurings of dementia. As the
clock on the mantel-shelf chimed seven, a knock
sounded on the door, and in answer to his “Entrez!”
Johann entered.</p>

<p>“Will Herr Arndt dress for dinner?” he asked.
“Herr Captain Lindenwald is not dressing, and
thought perhaps Herr Arndt would dine with him
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle à manger</i>. Fräulein von Altdorf is
indisposed, and is having some tea and toast in
her room.</p>

<p>“No, Johann,” Grey replied, after a moment’s
consideration, “I won’t dress. Give my compliments
to the Herr Captain, and say that I’m feeling
a bit seedy and will dine here alone, if he will
be so good as to excuse me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Johann bowed and was about to go, but stopped
with his hand on the doorknob.</p>

<p>“Will Herr Arndt order his dinner now?” he
queried; and Grey named the dishes.</p>

<p>His appetite, he all at once discovered, was excellent,
and when the table had been spread and
the courses followed one another in leisurely succession
and with admirable service, he found himself
eating with the relish that betokens good
digestion. It seemed, too, when he had finished
and lighted a cigarette that he could think more
calmly and coherently. The windows of his room
opened upon a narrow balcony, and placing a
chair he stepped out and sat there meditative above
the changeful tide of the boulevard which flowed
unceasingly below.</p>

<p>He was no longer exercised over the possible
effect of his cables, for he reflected that Carey
Grey, so far as all Paris save one man knew, was
still dead. A message or a messenger to the Hôtel
Grammont would find no such person. His
changed appearance, his changed name, and his
changed associates were a disguise that must
prove quite impenetrable. He would therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
have ample time, unhampered by either enemies
or friends, to delve into the perplexing riddle that
confronted him. It would be policy, he argued,
to delay his return to America until he could trace
his movements abroad. The difficulties that he
must encounter he did not pretend to belittle.
When he strove to lay out a plan of action he was
balked at the very outset. To ask questions was to
betray himself, and yet it must be a very long and
tedious, not to say perilous, procedure to attempt
to drift blindly with the current without either
chart or compass to warn him of rocks and shoals.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened into night, and as the
stars sparkled into the darkening canopy above
the electric lights flashed into a brighter brilliancy
along the boulevard below. Grey’s cigarette had
been tossed away, and he sat listlessly watching
the vari-coloured lamps of the cabs as they passed
to and fro—now a green, now a red, now a yellow.
He had moved his chair to the space of balcony
between the windows to escape an annoying draft,
and from where he sat he could neither see into
his room nor be seen from it. The scratching of
a match inside, however, was plainly audible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Someone evidently was lighting his candles. And
then the sound of voices came to him, and he
pricked his ears.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a catastrophe,” he heard. The
speaker was Johann. The accent was unmistakable.</p>

<p>“You have no idea. It is worse, a thousand
times worse than you know——”</p>

<p>Grey, with difficulty, choked back an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Lutz!” he muttered to himself, in astonishment.
“By all that’s good! Lutz! Here in
Paris, and with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the valet continued, “Herr Schlippenbach
was necessary to Herr Arndt. Without Herr
Schlippenbach, Herr Arndt is another man. He
is mad, Johann, and filled with wild notions. He
does not know his own people. He fancies he is
someone else. Herr Schlippenbach was his balance
wheel.”</p>

<p>“So!” murmured Johann. “So!”</p>

<p>“I have a great fear we shall never get him to
Kürschdorf at all.”</p>

<p>“But the Herr Captain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
“Oh, yes, the Herr Captain will do his best, I
am sure,” Lutz assented; “but it will be a mad
Prince, and not a sane one, he will have on his
hands.”</p>

<p>The comment that Johann made was not distinguishable.
They were going towards the door,
which Grey next heard open and then close
sharply, forced by the draft from the window.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> lacked but a few minutes of midnight
when Grey entered the smoke-clouded air
of the Café Américain. The great room
was crowded and the babel of voices and
the clatter of glass and china were wellnigh
deafening. He stood for a moment near the
door, looking about through half-closed lids like
one near-sighted. A dark, languorous-eyed woman,
gorgeous in scarlet silk and lace, smiled and beckoned
him, but he paid no heed. He forced his way
between the closely aligned tables to the centre of
the room, glancing from right to left as he proceeded.
His imagination had pictured his correspondent
as a youngish, fair man, but he realised
that his imagination was not to be relied on. He
must depend on being seen and recognised, since
recognition on his part was impossible. A waiter
brushed against him, spattering him with beer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
from jostled glasses. A pretty brunette in a white
gown and a great rose-trimmed hat of coarse
straw seized his hand and pressed it suggestively
as she passed him on her way to the door. And
then, over near the mirrored wall to the right, he
saw a man standing, his arm raised to attract
attention, a smile on his honest, sun-browned face;
and he knew it was “Jack.” He was tall and
spare, all muscle and sinew, and his hair was
brightly red, as also was his rather close-cropped
moustache.</p>

<p>“Gad, man,” he exclaimed, as Grey came to
him, “I fancied you weren’t to be here.”</p>

<p>He spoke with the pleasant brogue of the North
of Ireland, and his voice and manner were as confidence-inspiring
as had been his note.</p>

<p>Grey smiled, with something of embarrassment
in his eyes. The very frankness of the other man
was disconcerting. It had been comparatively easy
to hide his simulation from the others, but now it
was different. This big, hearty fellow was not
only all honesty himself, but he inspired honesty—he
demanded it.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” the American replied, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
that a confession was about to be wrung from
him, “I’ve had a rather wretched day.”</p>

<p>Jack looked at him keenly, his lips pressed tight
in cogitation, as Grey ordered a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grenadine</i>.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, old chap?” he asked presently,
throwing back his head and sending an inverted
cone of cigarette smoke ceilingward. “Tell
me about it; you don’t look well; you are pale
and—by Jove! What’s the matter with your
voice? You don’t speak like yourself. If I
didn’t see you sitting there I’d fancy it was another
man who spoke.”</p>

<p>“Would you, really?” Grey asked. The information,
seeing that it was necessary for him to
keep up his masquerade for awhile, was disconcerting.</p>

<p>“Really, you have quite lost something—or
perhaps I should say you have gained something.
Your tone now has some colour, some modulation.
Yesterday you spoke like—you’ll pardon me, won’t
you?—you spoke like an automaton.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind giving me an imitation?”
Grey laughed. “Oh, yes, I am serious. I want
to hear you. After awhile I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
“Since it is your pleasure, my dear Max,” Jack
replied in an even drone at low pitch, “I am only
too delighted to do as I am bidden. There you
are! That’s not exaggerated the least bit, either.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Grey said; and then he sat for a
full minute in silence. He was impelled to make
a clean breast of the whole astounding affair to
this man and ask his aid. Though he was unacquainted
even with his name he felt he could trust
him. In this sudden and inexplicable faith his
aversion for Herr Schlippenbach and Captain Lindenwald
found its antithesis. He nevertheless
appreciated the importance of extreme caution,
and his judgment warred for the moment with his
impulse. Finally a truce was signed.</p>

<p>“Was yesterday’s tone an affectation or is today’s?”
asked the Irishman jocularly.</p>

<p>Grey took a sip at the pink contents of his glass.</p>

<p>“Neither,” he answered, seriously; “yesterday
I was asleep; today I am awake.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, man! Don’t talk in riddles,” the
other protested. “You were no more asleep last
night at Maxim’s than you are this minute. By
the way, did you see your friend Sarema as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
came in? She was sitting quite near the door a
little while ago.”</p>

<p>“Sarema?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Come, come, my lad, has your
mood changed as well as your tone and voice?
You certainly remember the odalisque from the
Folies Bergères.”</p>

<p>Grey’s eyes showed that his astonishment was
unfeigned.</p>

<p>“Oh, but this is marvellous,” cried Jack,
leaning forward, his arms on the table. “You
weren’t drunk, man. You—you certainly weren’t
asleep.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” Grey asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Fancy!” exclaimed the Irishman. “Have
you forgotten that, too? John James O’Hara,
lieutenant in His Majesty’s Second Dragoon
Guards, of Kirwan Lodge, Drumsna, County
Leitrim, at your service, sir. And you’ll be telling
me next, I suppose, that you don’t remember meeting
me in the smoke-room of the <i>Lucania</i> the first
day out of New York, and that over two months
ago.</p>

<p>“As God is my judge,” Grey answered, solemnly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“I have no recollection of ever seeing you
before tonight.”</p>

<p>O’Hara’s muscles stiffened and then relaxed.
There was no incredulity in his face, only
wonder.</p>

<p>“And have you forgotten your own name,
too?” he queried, after a moment.</p>

<p>“I never knew the name I am called by until
today.”</p>

<p>“Gad, man, you’re crazy,” the Irishman commented,
lighting a fresh cigarette. “You’ve got
me all of a tangle. I’m damned if you’re not uncanny.
And your name is not Max Arndt at all,
then?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And Herr Schlippenbach. He is not your
uncle?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!”</p>

<p>“And the Fräulein von Altdorf is not your
sister’s daughter, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I never had a sister.”</p>

<p>The dragoon guard threw up his hands.</p>

<p>“Then, if it’s all the same to you,” he continued,
“and not revealing any State secrets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
would you be so good as to tell me who you are?
Introduce yourself to me. For it seems that
though we’ve been together the better part of two
months we’re still strangers.”</p>

<p>Grey made a rapid but careful survey of his
neighbours. Under the circumstances it might
not be well to speak his own name where it could
be overheard. He took another drink of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grenadine</i>
before replying.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said, “this is hardly the place for
confidences. What do you say to walking over to
my hotel? We can have privacy there.”</p>

<p>And Lieutenant O’Hara readily consented.</p>

<p>At the door of the Hôtel Grammont a courier
was in excited dispute with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>.</p>

<p>“But he will be here tomorrow, perhaps. Is it
not so?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say. There is no Monsieur Grey here
now, of a certainty.”</p>

<p>“You are sure? You are most sure?”</p>

<p>“Is it not that I have said it twenty—thirty—a
hundred times?” insisted the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>. “And you
are not the only one who has asked. There have
been three others here, including an agent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
police. Ah, Monsieur Grey! He had better stay
away, perhaps.”</p>

<p>When at length the room of the American was
reached and the door locked on the inside, Grey
turned to his friend.</p>

<p>“Did you overhear the conversation below?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I caught snatches of it. A wire for someone,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; for me.”</p>

<p>“For you?” O’Hara stared. “Then why in
God’s name didn’t you take it?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t afford to, and yet I’d give a good
deal to know its message.”</p>

<p>“But it was for a person named Grey, I
thought. You are Grey, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the police officer! He was looking for—you?”</p>

<p>“For me,” Grey confessed. “Now you can
understand why I didn’t care to talk in the café.”</p>

<p>O’Hara dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“This is very interesting,” he said, and his blue
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Grey, his hands in his trousers’ pockets, was
standing before the chimney-piece. His expression
was very grave.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he began, “that you think me
rather a blackguard. Appearances so far are
against me, aren’t they? By my own admission
I’m here under an assumed name trying to evade
the minions of the law, who are hot-foot on my
trail. Everything you thought you knew about
me I have informed you is false. Therefore you
are not likely to be predisposed in my favour.
Consequently the story I’m going to tell you now
you’ll probably not believe. I’m free to admit that
if the situation were reversed I wouldn’t believe
you; and yet—I—well, I wouldn’t have taken
you into my confidence if it were not that I’m sure
you’re a gentleman—an honest, high-principled,
Irish gentleman who loves right and is willing to
fight for it.”</p>

<p>O’Hara smiled encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Drive ahead, my boy,” he urged; “the jury
is absolutely unprejudiced.”</p>

<p>Then Grey plunged into a detailed narrative of
that surprising day. He told of his strange awakening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and parenthetically gave his hearer an idea
of his position at home and a glimpse of his previous
life. He rehearsed his conversation with
Frothingham; he repeated word for word the
cables he had sent to New York; he summarized
the articles he had read in the <i>Herald</i>; he described
the passing of Herr Schlippenbach and
recited his death-bed communication, and finally
he gave, as nearly as he could remember it, the
conversation between Lutz and Johann.</p>

<p>O’Hara listened with rapt interest, interrupting
him now and then with a question, at times smiling
understandingly and at others scowling at
what he regarded as evidence of importance
against the little group by which Grey was surrounded.
At the conclusion of the recital he
sprang up and impulsively grasped the American’s
hand.</p>

<p>“You’ll come out on top yet, boy,” he cried,
“and it’s John James O’Hara that’ll help to put
you there. I’ve heard of such cases as this before.
They’ve been drugging you, lad, that’s as plain
as the nose on my face, and your dear uncle, Herr
Schlippenbach, do you mind, has been the chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
drugger. It was because he was too ill to do his
work that the effects wore off. Now that he’s
gone they’re worried to death over you. Sure,
you’re not so blind that you can’t see that yourself.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand——”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. Neither do I. There’s
a lot we have got to find out. But two heads are
better than one; and you just put a big bundle of
trust in mine.”</p>

<p>He was excited and his brogue, Grey thought,
was delightful.</p>

<p>“What do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“In the first place it is probably best that I tell
you what little I know. Your memory, up until
this afternoon, is a blank. Well, then, I’ll give you
the benefit of mine.”</p>

<p>O’Hara lighted another cigarette and, taking a
deep inhalation, started pacing the floor, his head
bent thoughtfully forward.</p>

<p>“As I said,” he began, “we met in the smoke-room
of the <i>Lucania</i> on the afternoon of Saturday,
the seventh of April. You told me your
name was Max Arndt, that you were born in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Kürschdorf, the capital of Budavia, where your
uncle, Herr Schlippenbach, whom you accompanied,
had at one time been tutor in the royal family.
You had spent your life, however, in the
United States, had been engaged in the importation
of German wines, I think you said, in New
York, and were now on your way back to your
native town, where, by the death of a relation,
you had recently come into large estates. The
man Lutz was with you, but he appeared to be old
Schlippenbach’s valet rather than yours. On
reaching Liverpool you were met by Captain Lindenwald,
who is of the royal household of the
Kingdom of Budavia, and by the fellow Johann.
After about a week in London your party was
joined by Miss von Altdorf, who had been at
school somewhere in Kent. You told me she was
your sister’s child, an orphan, and that your uncle
and yourself supported her.”</p>

<p>“Great God!” exclaimed Grey, amazedly,
“and did I seem sane—rational?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” O’Hara answered; “you were the
character to the smallest detail. Your voice
was the only peculiar thing about you. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
spoke like a deaf man, with practically no inflection.”</p>

<p>“Did you talk to Schlippenbach?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; frequently. He was really very
clever. He had a wonderful fund of general
knowledge. There was scarcely a subject with
which he was not familiar. But his specialty was
phrenology. He told me that in his youth he had
known Dr. Spurzheim, the pupil of Dr. Franz
Gall, the founder of the science, that he had
studied under him and gone very deeply into the
matter. He was a chemist, too, and from something
he let drop one day I got the impression that
he had experimented considerably with anæsthetics,
narcotics, and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“And to some purpose, apparently,” put in
Grey. “But his object, O’Hara? What in
heaven’s name could have been his object? I
never knew him—never saw him to my recollection
until he was dying.”</p>

<p>“Ah, lad, we haven’t got that far yet, but we’ll
know before we’re through.”</p>

<p>And then he went on with his story. He was
with the quartet a great deal in London, he said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
He showed them about, and they were all very
appreciative. They stopped there until the middle
of May and then they moved on to Paris. Without
any intention of prying into their affairs he
had observed that Herr Schlippenbach and Captain
Lindenwald had a good deal of correspondence
with parties in Kürschdorf.</p>

<p>“And what was my attitude towards them all?”
Grey inquired. “Was I very sociable or was I
reserved?”</p>

<p>“You were rather dignified,” O’Hara answered;
“and now I come to think of it, they
treated you with considerable deference, though
they endeavoured to dissemble it whenever I was
about. Miss von Altdorf seemed quite fond of
you, old chap, and it was amusing to note how
Captain Lindenwald insisted on making love to
her at every opportunity, only to be gently, but
firmly, repulsed. As for that young woman I
found her most charming,—and you did too, apparently.
Of course, as she was your niece, you
could take her to dine tête-à-tête and to places of
amusement unchaperoned, and you did very frequently,
much to Lindenwald’s annoyance. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the plot is, Grey, I feel satisfied that she is
not in it.”</p>

<p>“And now what do you advise?”</p>

<p>“For the present at least to give no sign that
you suspect anything. You are well enough
posted now, my boy, to go straight ahead. Give
them enough rope and they’ll hang themselves as
sure as your name’s Grey and mine’s O’Hara.
Assume the tone I told you of, and they’ll never
suspect. They may be surprised, but they’ll be
happy and they’ll be unwary. Never take the initiative
yourself. Leave it all to Lindenwald.”</p>

<p>“But what will they make out of it?” Grey
urged, curiously. “Surely you have formed some
theory?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a theory,” O’Hara responded,
“but it is probably just as well for me to keep it
to myself for a while.”</p>

<p>“What do you think this talk about ‘thrones’
and ‘mad princes’ means?”</p>

<p>“That is for us to find out. And unless I am
more of a fool than I think, it will very shortly
develop. In the meantime you are anxious about
the answers to your cables, aren’t you? Since they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
are addressed to Grey, you can’t accept them,
that’s clear. But you shall know what is in them
just the same. I’ll undertake that for you.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Never mind, lad; leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“And the box with proofs that Schlippenbach
spoke of? That is important.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. It is at the Gare du Nord in his
name or yours, eh? I’ll get it for you. But the
key?”</p>

<p>Suddenly Grey remembered.</p>

<p>“There is a key in a wallet I found. Possibly
that is it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>And the thought of the wallet reminded him
that a fifty-franc note and some change was all
the money he had in his possession.</p>

<p>“I’m a little short of funds,” he said. “Do
you happen to know how or where I have been in
the habit of getting money when I needed it?”</p>

<p>O’Hara laughed.</p>

<p>“The whole thing is so absurd,” he explained,
“as well as serious. Fancy your not knowing
what you have done every few days since you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
landed! Johann has your letter of credit and gets
you whatever you desire. All that is necessary
is for you to sign your name.”</p>

<p>When O’Hara had gone Grey sat for a long
time brooding over his extraordinary experience.
His head was still aching, throbbingly, and his
nerves were still a-tingle. Whatever treatment
he had been subjected to its effects had not yet
been entirely eliminated. He undressed, got into
his pyjamas and went to bed; but sleep was coy
and not to be won by wooing. He heard the
clock strike two and three and four, and he saw
the first gray sign of dawn between his curtains
before he fell into a restless, troubled, unrefreshing
slumber.</p>

<h2><a id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mr. Herbert Frothingham</span>
had that evening been one of a
dinner party of six at Armenonville.
He had sat between Miss
Hope Van Tuyl and Lady Constance Vincent,
and across a plateau of primrose-coloured orchids
the charming Mrs. Dickie Venable had at
intervals favoured him with fleeting smiles.
Nicholas Van Tuyl, sleek and ruddy, was
at the left of Lady Constance, who had for her
vis-à-vis Sinclair Edson, a tall, young, sallow-faced
secretary from the United States Embassy.</p>

<p>“I hope you haven’t failed to observe the notabilities,”
this latter-named gentleman was saying
as he daintily dissected his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carpe au buerre noir</i>;
“there are quite a number here this evening.”
His pose as mentor was apt to grow annoying at
times, but the Van Tuyls had been in Paris only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
two days, and father and daughter were alike interested.</p>

<p>“Oh, do show me that East Indian prince or
whatever he is,” cried Hope enthusiastically, her
great dark eyes brilliant; “I’ve heard so much of
him. Is he here?”</p>

<p>“The Maharajah of Kahlapore? Yes, he must
be here, surely. I never come nowadays but he is.”</p>

<p>He turned his head and craned his neck in an
effort to locate the Hindu potentate. The piazza
of the pavilion was, as usual, crowded. Every
table was occupied—and the throng was the acme
of cosmopolitanism. Five continents were represented.
It was indeed a veritable congress of nations.
Monarchs, kings dethroned, and pretenders
rubbed elbows. Women of the world and of the
half-world brushed skirts. Dazzling toilets of
delicate tints were silhouetted against coats of
lustreless black. Diamonds blazed; pearls reflected
the myriad lights; gems of all colours,
shapes, and sizes glistened in the foreground and
sparkled in remote corners.</p>

<p>“Ah, there he is,” Edson discovered, speaking
without turning his face; “there, off to the right.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
You can just see his white turban over the head of
that Titian-haired woman in the blue gown.”</p>

<p>The whole party stared, stretching, twisting to
get a glimpse.</p>

<p>“Rather insignificant, isn’t he?” observed Mrs.
Dickie disparagingly.</p>

<p>“His turban accentuates his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café au lait</i> complexion,”
laughed Hope.</p>

<p>“But you should see him at finger-bowl time,”
suggested Lady Constance, who had lunched next
to him and his suite that day at Paillard’s. “He
is most original.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell us,” cried Hope pleadingly; “what
does he do?”</p>

<p>“It must be seen to be appreciated,” the Englishwoman
replied. She was auburn-haired, generously
proportioned, and rather stolid. Her tone
was even more of a refusal than her words.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” volunteered Edson glibly. “He
has a special bowl twice the ordinary size and he
plunges his whole face in it.”</p>

<p>“Horrors!” shrieked Mrs. Dickie; “he should
be arrested for attempted suicide.”</p>

<p>“But he isn’t the most interesting personage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
here by any means,” Edson pursued, now thoroughly
launched in the exercise of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">métier</i>;
“have you noticed the sallow-faced, heavy-browed
and long-moustached gentleman just three tables
away, dining with the dark-bearded president of
the Chamber of Deputies?”</p>

<p>“The man with that enormous, gorgeously jewelled
star on his breast?” asked Miss Van Tuyl,
leaning back and gazing over Frothingham’s
shoulder. “Oh, what a brutal face he has!”</p>

<p>“It is the Shah of Persia,” announced Edson;
and then he glanced about to revel in the effect of
his revelation.</p>

<p>“He’s a beast,” commented Lady Constance,
disgustedly, “though I believe his manners have
improved somewhat since he was here last. Do
you know when he was in Berlin some years ago
he sat next to the Empress Augusta at a State
banquet, and whenever he got anything in his
mouth that was not to his taste, he just calmly
removed it!”</p>

<p>“They say he thought nothing of putting his
hands on the bare shoulders of the women he
met,” Edson added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“I saw the King of the Belgians as we came in,”
said Mr. Van Tuyl, presently, as a waiter passed
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">filet aux truffes</i>; “one sees him everywhere,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Edson hastened to observe; “he’s
as omnipresent as the poor. But did you see the
woman with him? She’s the very latest, you
know. Was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quartier Latin</i> model six months
ago and is now regarded as the most beautiful
woman in Paris. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Minette Blanche</i>, they call
her. She has a palace on the Boulevard Malesherbes
and as many retainers as a princess.”</p>

<p>“The old scoundrel!” exclaimed Mrs. Dickie,
vindictively; “I don’t know which is worse, the
Shah or he. He gained a reputation as a wife-beater
or something, didn’t he? At all events I’ll
bet the devil is keeping a griddle hot for him down
below, and it’s pretty near time he occupied it.”</p>

<p>“How terribly spiteful!” laughed Frothingham;
“His Majesty isn’t a bad sort at all; a little
fickle, perhaps, but with his love of beauty and his
opportunities you can hardly expect domesticity.
And he’s done a lot of good in his way.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of royalty, that is rather an odd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
condition of affairs in Budavia, by the way,” suggested
Nicholas Van Tuyl. “Did you see the
paper this morning? The King is very ill. Can’t
live a fortnight; and there is a question as to the
succession. It seems that the Crown Prince was
kidnapped when he was five years old and nothing
has ever been heard of him. They don’t know
whether he is alive or dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how interesting!” exclaimed Mrs. Dickie,
putting down her fork to listen. “And to whom
does the crown go?”</p>

<p>“To King Frederic’s nephew, Prince Hugo; as
thorough a reprobate, they say, as there is in all
Europe.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be funny if the Crown Prince
should turn up at this juncture?” suggested Edson;
and there was something significant in his
tone.</p>

<p>“Has such a possibility been hinted at?” asked
Van Tuyl.</p>

<p>“Well—” and Edson hesitated the briefest
moment, “one can never tell.” Whether intentionally
or not, he gave the impression that he
knew more than he cared to divulge. “I had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
call today from an officer of the Budavian army.
He is a member of the royal household.” He said
this with an air, and Frothingham muttered,
“Snob!” under his breath.</p>

<p>“I suppose he spoke of the situation, eh?”
asked Van Tuyl.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, he referred to it. I met him
last year in Vienna. His call was purely social.”</p>

<p>“Is he to be in Paris long?” asked Mrs. Dickie,
quickly. “Bring him to tea next Tuesday.”</p>

<p>But Edson evaded a promise. He was listening
to Frothingham, who was saying:</p>

<p>“You can never tell when or where or under
what circumstances a lost man will reappear. After
today I shall make it a rule not to believe a man
is dead unless I have seen him buried.”</p>

<p>“Why, whom on earth have you seen?” questioned
Miss Van Tuyl. There was just the slightest
suspicion of a tremour in her voice, and her
eyes were apprehensive. The speaker, however, detected
neither. He had, in fact, quite forgotten,
if he had ever heard, that there had been an attachment
between the man he had that day met on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">terrasse</i> of the Café de la Paix and the woman
who sat at his side.</p>

<p>“Carey Grey, the absconder!”</p>

<p>The words struck her as a blow from a clenched
fist. Her cheeks, which had been a trifle flushed,
went suddenly white as the damask napery. Her
jewelled fingers clutched the edge of the table.
She felt that she was falling backward, that everything
was receding, and she caught the table edge
to save herself.</p>

<p>“Carey Grey!” repeated Nicholas Van Tuyl,
in amazement. “Surely you must have been mistaken!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. I talked to him.”</p>

<p>“The devil!” exclaimed Edson and then apologised.</p>

<p>“You’d never know him,” Frothingham went
on, after emptying his champagne glass; “he has
bleached his hair, and he is wearing a bleached
beard, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, horrible!” This from Mrs. Dickie.</p>

<p>“Told a most remarkable story about not knowing
anything for five months; brain fever or something.
I must admit he was very convincing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
“I wonder if that is the man I knew?” Lady
Constance broke in. “He came over with an
American polo team; he was a great friend of
Lord Stanniscourt’s.”</p>

<p>“Same man,” said Van Tuyl, with a glint of
admiration in his tone. “He was a capital polo
player, and—yes, by Jove, a rattling good fellow
in every way. It was a surprise to everyone when
he went wrong.” He had been watching his
daughter with no little anxiety. Now her colour
was returning and her hands were in her lap.</p>

<p>“Yes, to everyone,” Mrs. Dickie volunteered,
“the whole thing was simply astounding. He
had a good business, hadn’t he? What do you
suppose he wanted with that money?”</p>

<p>“Nobody was ever able to conjecture,” answered
Frothingham, as he helped himself to some
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">caneton</i>.</p>

<p>“And he is really here in Paris?” queried
Edson, twirling the long stem of a fragile
wineglass between thumb and finger. “Where is
he stopping?”</p>

<p>Hope Van Tuyl unconsciously leaned forward
to catch the address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“I don’t know. I never thought to inquire.”</p>

<p>From the violins of the tziganes glided the
languorous strains of the “Valse Bleue,” and instantly
all other sounds dwindled. Even the clatter
of knives and forks seemed gradually to cease
and the babble of tongues was vague and far
away. Into the girl’s dark eyes came an expression
of melancholy, and the corners of her red-lipped
mouth drooped. The leaves of her calendar
had been fluttered back a twelvemonth by the melody,
and she was out under the stars with the cool
breeze from the Hudson fanning her flushed
cheeks. Through the open French windows of
the clubhouse at her back the music was floating.
Beside her, his arm girdling her waist, was the
man to whom she had just promised her love and
loyalty—the man whose name she would be proud
to wear through all her days—Carey Grey. The
ineffable joy, the blissful content of the moment
were, in some mystic manner, reborn by the chords
that sang and swelled and vibrated and whispered,
and yet over all, mingling with the delicious, intoxicating
happiness of this reincarnated experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
was an overpowering sense of loss—dire,
monstrous, crushing.</p>

<p>“Hope, dear,”—it was her father’s voice that
brought her back to the present. His anxious
eyes had still been upon her. “Drink your wine,
girl; you aren’t ill, are you? Mr. Edson has been
speaking to you and I don’t believe you’ve heard
a word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Edson,” she ejaculated,
recovering herself. “I fear for the
moment I was very far off. Would you mind
repeating what you said?”</p>

<p>“I was proposing a coaching party to Versailles
for Saturday, and as everybody seemed to approve
I took the opportunity to ask you if you would do
me the honour of occupying the box seat.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” she accepted, smiling bravely,
though a dull, leaden pain was gripping her heart;
“I think it will be simply lovely.”</p>

<p>The sextet had come to the restaurant crowded
into Mr. Edson’s big touring car, and when at
length the dinner was finished and the men had
smoked their cigars and the moon had come up
from behind the trees and floated like a silver boat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in the deep blue sea of the heavens, they took their
places again and went spinning at frantic speed
out into the Allée de Longchamp. A quick turn to
the left and in another instant the Porte Dauphine
had been passed and the machine was flying
smoothly down the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne
with the Arc de Triomphe rising massively white
in the moonlight ahead.</p>

<p>Frothingham found himself brought very close
to Hope Van Tuyl by the exigencies of the
arrangement of six goodly sized persons in a space
designed for five; and he was glad that it was so.
He had seen much of her during the winter season
in New York, and he had come abroad chiefly
because he knew that she and her father had
planned to spend the early summer in Europe.
She was the type of woman he admired. She was
tall and athletic, fond of sports and clever at them,
but not so much of an enthusiast as to be open to
the charge of having unsexed herself. She was,
indeed, intensely feminine. Though she could
handle a coach and four as dexterously as the
average masculine whip and could drive a golf ball
well on to two hundred yards, her hands were as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
delicately white and her fingers as long and taper
as those of a girl whose most strenuous exertion
was the execution of a Chopin nocturne. Her hair
was dark, almost black, with glinting bronze reflections
in the sunlight. Her eyes were the brown
of chestnuts and her eyebrows black and perfectly
arched. Frothingham had dreamed night after
night of her mouth—it was so red and so tenderly
curved, and her lips seemed always moist.</p>

<p>He had noticed her preoccupation towards the
close of the dinner, and he had marvelled as to
the cause. It was such an unusual mood for her.
Now, as they were sweeping with exhilarating
speed down the long avenue, with its double row
of glittering lights that flashed by in streaks—while
all the rest were laughing, shouting, shrieking
in the exuberance of the moment—she was
still abstracted, silent.</p>

<p>Frothingham ventured to place a hand over one
of hers, but she drew her own away instantly, as
though the contact were painful. He fancied then
that he had perhaps unwittingly offended her in
some way, and he whispered, close to her ear:</p>

<p>“I hope you are not annoyed at me. Have I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
been guilty of any discourtesy? I am sure
I——”</p>

<p>But it was very evident she was not listening,
and he broke off in the middle of the sentence.</p>

<p>The Van Tuyls were stopping at the Ritz, and
there Edson put them down. Frothingham, who
had taken lodgings not far away, alighted too,
and Nicholas Van Tuyl asked him in.</p>

<p>“I feel like a brandy and soda,” he said, “and
I want company.”</p>

<p>Hope excused herself and went directly to her
room. She was very nervous and very <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">distraite</i>.
The story that Carey Grey was not only alive and
in Paris, but had been ill, delirious and therefore
unaccountable, disquieted and distressed her. She
had loved him more than she knew until his crime
and his flight, and, above all, his desertion without
a word of explanation, revealed to her the fulness
of her passion. Then she had battled with
herself for a time; had grown philosophic and had
reasoned, and eventually had gathered together
the pages of her life that bore his name, had torn
them out and, as she believed, destroyed them
utterly. And now they were here before her, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
restored as a magician makes whole again
the articles that he tears into bits before his auditors’
eyes.</p>

<p>As she entered her room her maid, who had
been reading near a window, arose, took up something
from her dressing-table and came toward
her with it in her outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“A telegram for m’amselle,” she said. She was
a very pretty French maid, and she had a very
delicious French accent. She preferred to speak
in English, though Miss Van Tuyl invariably
answered her in French. “It came not ten minutes
ago, m’amselle.”</p>

<p>Hope walked listlessly to where an electric lamp
glowed under a Dresden shade, tearing open the
envelope as she went. Unfolding the inclosure,
she held it in the light’s glare; and then the little
blue sheet dropped from her nerveless fingers, and
she reeled. Had it not been for Marcelle she might
have fallen; but the girl, burning with curiosity
to learn the contents of the telegram—or cablegram,
as it proved—had followed her mistress’s
every movement, and now her arm was about her
waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
“Oh, m’amselle, m’amselle,” she cried in alarm;
“my poor m’amselle! Is it that you hear the bad
news?”</p>

<p>But Miss Van Tuyl made no reply. Recovering
herself, she crossed the room and sat down in the
chair by the window that Marcelle had just
vacated. The girl stood for a moment irresolute.
Then she stooped and picked up the sheet of blue
paper, placing it on the table under the lamp.
As she did so her quick eye took in enough to
satisfy her as to its import. It was from Miss
Van Tuyl’s brother in New York, and it repeated
a cable just received. The words made a very
deep impression on Marcelle because of one of
them, of which, though it was quite as much
French as it was English, she did not know the
meaning.</p>

<p>“That he is here in Paris I can understand;
and that he is alive and well, oh, yes!” she iterated
and reiterated to herself; “but what is it he means
by ‘<em>in-ex-pleek-able</em>’? ‘Conditions <em>in-ex-pleek-able</em>’?
Oh, I fear, I fear, that is something very
terrible.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> came a gentle tap on Grey’s
door; then a rap, louder and more
insistent; and then repeated knocking,
aggressive, commanding; and
Grey, aroused suddenly from what was more
stupor than sleep, sat up in bed, startled, crying:</p>

<p>“Come in! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entrez! Herein!</i>”</p>

<p>The door opened and Johann entered.</p>

<p>“It is long after noon, Herr Arndt,” he said,
bowing, “and the funeral is arranged for three
o’clock.”</p>

<p>Grey rubbed his eyes and made an effort to collect
his scattered senses.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” he murmured, after a moment;
“Herr Schlippenbach’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“It is very wet,” Johann continued; “since six
this morning it has been raining. I have ordered
Herr Arndt’s coffee. It will be here presently.”</p>

<p>“And my tub?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
“It waits, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>While Grey, in bathrobe and slippers, was sipping
his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">café au lait</i> and nibbling a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brioche</i>, Captain
Lindenwald presented himself.</p>

<p>“I have arranged everything,” he announced,
with an air of thorough self-satisfaction; “for
the present we will leave the remains here in
Paris. Later we can decide whether they shall be
brought on to Kürschdorf or sent back to America.
I have placed all the details of the obsequies in
the hands of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Compagnie des Pompes Funèbres</i>.
The temporary interment will be this afternoon at
Père-la-Chaise. Will it be the pleasure of Herr
Arndt to attend?”</p>

<p>Grey raised his cup to his lips and replaced it
on the saucer before replying. He wished to make
sure that he could rid his tone of all modulation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, speaking with great care,
“I will go.” If he was to play the game it were
better that he played every hand dealt to him.</p>

<p>After a little he asked:</p>

<p>“And the Fraülein von Altdorf? How is she
today?”</p>

<p>“Oh, much better,” returned the Herr Captain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
his face beaming; “she is more composed, more
resigned. She is a wonderful young woman, Herr
Arndt; and oh, she is so beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is very lovely,” Grey acquiesced.</p>

<p>But his thoughts at the moment were not of her.
Lindenwald’s eulogy had set vibrant a chord of
emotion, had conjured a picture, had reproduced
a dream that seemed a reality. It was indeed difficult
for him to reconcile the remembrance of that
sleep fantasy, so vivid was it in every detail, with
the knowledge that it was not a waking experience.
He had sat for hours, it seemed, beside Hope Van
Tuyl, gazing into the limpid depths of her sympathetic
eyes, listening to the melody of her clear,
full-toned voice. They were in a great garden with
parterres of gay, sweet-scented flowers—roses and
heliotrope and geraniums—and smooth terraces
of greensward with marble nymphs and satyrs on
mossy pedestals, and above them the kindly, protecting,
leafy branches of an old oak. He had, he
thought, just found again the girl he loved—found
her after a long, long separation, and now she was
close within his hungry arms and her lips were
always very near his own. He was telling her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
some fantastic tale, like a bit culled from the
Arthurian legends, of how he was a great king,
and had only been away to claim his own, and now
she was to be his queen and sit beside him on the
throne in robes of purple and ermine and help him
rule his people with justice and mercy.</p>

<p>Yet here he was sitting in a Paris hotel bedchamber,
with a man who was almost a stranger,
while the rain was pelting on the window-panes
and the room was so gloomy that he could scarcely
see the face of his visitor. The recollection of the
dream thus contrasted filled him with a spirit of
rebellion. He was beset with an impulse to reveal
without further delay his true condition and let
the culprits, whoever they might be, escape with
their object undefined and their plunder unrestored.
The craving to see and hold and talk to
the woman he adored obsessed him for the
moment, and he felt that all else was trivial and
futile.</p>

<p>It was in this mood still that Jack O’Hara found
him an hour later.</p>

<p>“I am off to America by the first steamer,” he
said, joyously. “It is all tommyrot following this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
thing up. I’m going back, tell everything as far
as I know, and let the police do the rest.”</p>

<p>The Irishman looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“What’s come over you, lad?” he asked, solemnly.
“Have you gone off your head or are
you dreaming? Sure you’re not going to back out
now when we’ve got such a pretty little fight ahead
of us, with the enemy in ambush and afraid to
show their colours?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not off my head,” Grey replied a little
less gaily. He did not like the suggested imputation
of cowardice.</p>

<p>“Then you are dreaming, sure.”</p>

<p>“I have been.” The reply was ambiguous, but
O’Hara took it that his friend had changed his
mind.</p>

<p>“And you’re not now; you’re awake, wide
awake, eh? And you’re going to stop and rout
’em, horse, foot, and dragoon? That’s right,
man. What the devil put the going-home notion
in your noddle? I’ll wager twenty pounds it’s a
woman you’ve been thinking of.”</p>

<p>Grey stood by the window looking out on the
drenched Boulevard. O’Hara’s words were an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
inspiration, but the face and form of Hope were
still before him and her voice still echoed in his
ears. The longing would not easily down.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking after your blessed cablegrams,”
the Irishman went on. “There’s only
one there for you. I told ’em my name was Grey
and opened it and read it. Then I gave it back
to ’em, and explained it must be for same other
Grey. I told ’em my name was Charley, and that
that was addressed to Carey.”</p>

<p>“Only one?” Grey exclaimed, in a tone of disappointment,
turning. “I don’t suppose Mallory
will answer. What a damned blackguard he must
think me! He’s handed my cable over to the police,
of course. I suppose extradition papers are under
way by this time. But the one? What was it?”</p>

<p>“Here, I wrote it down so as not to forget,”
and O’Hara, after fumbling in his breast pocket,
produced an envelope on which was written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Overcome with joy. I never gave up hope. God bless
you.—<span class="smcap">Mother.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Grey turned to the window again, his eyes as
wet as the panes. After a little he asked:</p>

<p>“And that was the only one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
“The only one.”</p>

<p>Then Hope had not answered. She believed
him guilty, of course. It would have been better
to have let her, like the rest of the world, think
him dead. What a trickster is the weaver of
dreams! How real had seemed his vision, and yet
how untrue! And he had thought of going to her
as fast as the speediest ocean liner could take
him. Oh, yes, he was awake now; wide, wide
awake.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get the box at the Gare du Nord,”
O’Hara continued. “They’d given a brass or
something for it and had no record of your name
or Schlippenbach’s either. You had better ask
Johann about it, or Lutz.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Grey.</p>

<p>A hearse had stopped before the door, and he
began now putting on his gloves.</p>

<p>“No,” he added as he buttoned the grey suèdes,
“I’m not going back to America, O’Hara. Maybe
I’ll never go back. I’m going to Schlippenbach’s
funeral now, and I’m going to follow this thing
to the end of the route if it takes me through hell.”
His face was very set and solemn, and he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
with a determination that made O’Hara’s eyes
dance.</p>

<p>“Bravo, lad!” he cried, enthusiastically. “I
still have two months’ leave, and I’ll go with you,
hand in hand, every step of the way.”</p>

<p>The drive to Père-la-Chaise was very long and
very boresome. Captain Lindenwald was not inclined
to conversation and Grey dared not attempt
to lead in the direction he wished, for fear of revealing
how little he knew of what had been prearranged.
He gathered, however, that it had been
planned to start for Budavia early in the following
week and that the death of Herr Schlippenbach
was not to interfere with this arrangement; but
of what they were going for—of what was to
follow their arrival, he could glean no hint.</p>

<p>On the return from the cemetery, however, an
incident occurred which he regarded as significant,
though it only added to his perplexity. The carriage
had just crossed the Place de la République,
past the great bronze statue which adorns
the square, and was rolling leisurely along the
Boulevard St. Martin, when Lindenwald suddenly
drew back in the corner in evident trepidation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
catching Grey’s arm and dragging him back with
him.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake!” he whispered, excitedly.
“Did you see that man?”</p>

<p>“What man?” Grey asked, a little annoyed.
He had seen a score of men. The day was waning;
the rain had ceased and there was the usual
crowd that throngs the boulevards at the green
hour.</p>

<p>Lindenwald clutched him tightly for a moment,
huddled away from the window of the voiture. At
this point the sidewalks are somewhat higher than
the roadway and they had both been looking up
at the pedestrians, more interested in the procession
than in each other.</p>

<p>“He was standing in front of the Folies Dramatiques,”
Lindenwald explained, presently; “his
presence here means no good.”</p>

<p>“But who?” Grey persisted.</p>

<p>“It was the Baron von Einhard. You know
who the Baron von Einhard is. Ah! It is very
plain. In some way, in spite of all our precautions,
Hugo has got word. We must now be more
than careful. The Baron, my dear Herr Arndt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
would not hesitate one little—one very little
moment to cut your throat if he got the chance.”
Lindenwald shut his teeth tight, puckered his lips,
and peered convincingly at Grey between half-lowered
lids.</p>

<p>The American crushed back an exclamation of
surprise. In its place he substituted an inquiry.</p>

<p>“What is the Baron like?” he asked, wondering
whether he had seen him. The question was
a risk, but he ventured.</p>

<p>“He is small, dark, sharp-featured. He looks
more like an Italian than a Budavian, and he is
vengeful. He is, too, oh, so shrewd! Six assassinations
are at his door, and yet—positively, Herr
Arndt, what I say is true—not one of them can be
brought home to him.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure it was he whom you saw?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite sure, of a certainty. I only trust he
did not see us. But his eyes are lynx-like. If he
saw us you can be assured we are even now being
followed. Will it be too warm, do you think, if I
lower the shade? He is not here alone, and they
are on the lookout.”</p>

<p>“As you think best,” Grey replied. And Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Lindenwald pulled down the silk covering of
the window.</p>

<p>When at length they alighted at the Hôtel
Grammont and entered the courtyard the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>
informed the Captain that a gentleman was waiting
for him in the reading-room. He went in,
with Grey, who wished to look at a newspaper,
closely following; and a tall, sallow-faced young
man, faultlessly attired, rose and came towards
them.</p>

<p>Grey turned aside to a table, but Lindenwald
greeted the caller with no little suavity of manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur Edson,” he said, affably, “this
is indeed an honour. You have not, I hope, been
waiting long?”</p>

<p>“I have a favour to ask,” the young diplomat
replied, “and I shall take only a moment of your
time, Captain. I today received advices from the
State Department at Washington that there is an
American stopping at this hotel whose name is
Grey, though they tell me here there is no one of
that name in the house. It seems he cabled to
New York yesterday and gave this as his address.
He is wanted for embezzlement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Grey overheard the words and stood motionless,
tense, listening eagerly. His eyes were bent over
the table, but it was so dark in the room that the
print of the paper before him was but a grey
blur.</p>

<p>“And you would like me to—?” asked Lindenwald.
There was no savour of agitation in his
voice, and Grey wondered how much or how little
he knew.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you might aid me. Fortunately
I have his description. I dined in company
with a man last night who has seen him. He is
tall, well set-up, and has fair hair, beard and
moustache.”</p>

<p>“There are many such,” replied the Captain,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>A servant entered with a burning wax taper,
and Grey stepped aside for him to light the gas
over the table. As he did so he faced Edson, and
the illumination lit his features.</p>

<p>“Ah, there,” the caller whispered, a little nervously,
“standing by the table behind you—there
is a man of the very type. Perhaps that is he.”</p>

<p>Captain Lindenwald turned his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
“Ha, ha!” he laughed, clapping his hand on
Edson’s shoulder, “that is very droll, very. Do
you remember what I told you yesterday at the
Embassy?”</p>

<p>Edson nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. But——”</p>

<p>“Well, it is he.”</p>

<p>“He?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure. In the strictest confidence,
mind you. I would not tell you were it not that
I want to assure you beyond all question that he,
of all persons, cannot be suspected.”</p>

<p>Grey smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“That man is——”</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned Lindenwald his voice very
low. “Yes, that man is His Royal Highness,
Prince Maximilian, heir apparent to the throne of
Budavia.”</p>

<p>In spite of the low tone of the speaker Grey
caught the words, and the blood went rushing to
his head and set him dizzy. What monstrous lie
was this? He heir apparent to the throne of
Budavia! He, a descendant of plain Puritan ancestry,
a republican of republicans, being posed as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
a royal personage! It was staggering. And this
was the solution to the riddle. This was why they
were going to Kürschdorf. Herr Arndt was a
name assumed. The Crown Prince was travelling
incognito. It was all too ridiculous. He had suspected
some mad scheme from Schlippenbach’s
death-bed admonition and from Lutz’s overheard
conversation with Johann, but this comic opera
dénouement was quite beyond anything he had
permitted himself to fancy.</p>

<p>The young gentleman from the United States
Embassy was evidently duly impressed. He coloured
and he apologised and he looked hard at
Grey to make sure that he would recognise Prince
Maximilian should he again chance to see him—dining
at Armenonville, for instance.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he added, with a faint smile, “that
you will not mention my stupid blunder to His
Royal Highness. I should be mortified to have
him know.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Lindenwald again, “he
would take it as a good joke. Oh, yes, I must tell
him. He will be so much amused.”</p>

<p>Edson sidled toward the door and the Budavian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
officer turned to accompany him, but stopped
short, his face suddenly pallid. Standing on the
threshold, not five paces away, was the small, wiry,
dark, sharp-featured man he had noticed on the
Boulevard St. Martin.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Herr Captain,” said the Baron
von Einhard, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>Captain Lindenwald saluted in military fashion,
and the Baron returned the salute as Edson
brushed by him into the passage.</p>

<p>“You did not, I suppose, expect to see me in
Paris, eh?” the newcomer observed.</p>

<p>“You were the last man for whom I looked,
Baron,” the officer rejoined. “What is the latest
news from Kürschdorf?”</p>

<p>“You have not seen the evening papers,
then?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“His Majesty is much worse. His condition
became alarming this morning, at nine o’clock.
He cannot, the doctors say, live over forty-eight
hours.” He made the announcement with an air
of pleasurable anticipation. “I should fancy,
Herr Captain, that your presence might be required<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
at the Palace. Or,” and there was a world
of cunning suggestion in his tone, “you have more
important business here in Paris?”</p>

<p>“As you say, Herr Baron,” Lindenwald replied,
visibly uncomfortable. He was questioning
whether the Baron had overheard his conversation
with Edson, and if so, how much. The man’s
small eyes were like the eyes of a snake, beady and
sinister. They compelled against one’s will.</p>

<p>“You remain here long?” von Einhard continued,
smiling insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“The length of my stay is undetermined.”</p>

<p>“I trust we shall meet again,” and the Baron,
still smiling, bowed, turned on his heel and
vanished.</p>

<p>Grey, who had been listening, now rejoined the
Captain.</p>

<p>“He followed us, evidently,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“He is a serpent,” Lindenwald commented,
gravely, “and one to be feared. He crawls in
the grass, gives no sign and strikes with poisoned
fang where and when least expected. We must
be very wary—very wary, indeed, until we are
quite sure he has left the city. Ah, and that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
not the worst—how can we ever be sure? This
is a case, Herr Arndt, where caution is more advisable
than valour.”</p>

<p>“And your advice is?” Grey queried.</p>

<p>“My advice is never to go out unaccompanied.
Already he is setting his traps, arranging his pitfalls.
You cannot conceive of his ingenuity. I
am vexed because I feel myself unequal to combat
his trickery. In fair fight I have no fear, but to
fence with von Einhard is to be always in danger
of the impalpable.”</p>

<p>When they had separated and Grey was alone
in his room, he flung himself into a comfortable
chair, lighted a cigarette and gave himself up to
reflection. The gravity of the affair was not to
be minimized, yet he could not repress a smile as
he thought of the triangular form the matter had
assumed and of the complications, ramifications
and cross-purposes that had developed. Personally
his object was to detect and bring to justice
those persons who had, for some reason not yet
divulged, been using him as a cat’s-paw to attain
an end of which he was also ignorant. He had,
of course, every reason to believe that in this plot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Captain Lindenwald was a prominent factor, and
as such his hand was against him. Meanwhile the
machinery of international justice had been set in
motion to bring about his own apprehension, extradition
and punishment for a crime he had never
contemplated and never willingly committed.
Whether to this infraction Captain Lindenwald
had been a party he had no means of knowing,
but now it had turned out that another enemy was
in the field—an aggressive foe seeking his life—and
in this new battle Captain Lindenwald,
strangely enough, was, it would seem, his staunch
ally. He wondered whether any man had ever
before been so harassed, so persecuted, so
maligned, so humiliated through no fault of his
own; and his sense of injury waxed more galling
and his resentment more turbulently avid. He
grew impatient of every hour’s delay in the chase,
restless under his enforced inaction and fretful
over the tardy revelation of past events and the
development of future plans.</p>

<p>Then the thought of the box at the Gare du
Nord recurred to him, and he got up and rang for
Johann. But the youth knew nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
“Lutz, perhaps,” he said; “it is possible that
Lutz knows. I will send him to you, Herr
Arndt.”</p>

<p>And a little later Lutz came in. His air was
timid and his manner uneasy. His eyes were furtive
and refused to meet his master’s, and his
fingers were in constant motion.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lutz,” Grey greeted him composedly, taking
great care to erase all modulation from his
tone, “there is somewhere, probably among poor
Herr Schlippenbach’s effects, a receipt or check
for a box at a railway station here in Paris—at
the Gare du Nord, in fact. I wish you would see
if you can find it for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt.” His gaze was on the
carpet.</p>

<p>“Immediately, Lutz.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>When he had gone Grey began pacing the
floor like a madman, his fists clenched, his eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>“Was ever guilt more apparent?” he asked
himself. “It is written all over him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
And he wondered how he had controlled himself,
how he had refrained from catching him by
the throat and strangling a confession from him
without more ado.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Grey</span> dined that evening across the
Boulevard at the Maison Dorée, in
company with Fräulein von Altdorf
and Herr Captain Lindenwald; and,
as the officer insisted that it was advisable for
them to avoid as much as possible the
public eye, the trio dined in a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cabinet particulier</i>
on the second floor with windows open on the
street. It was not a very gay dinner, in spite of
the Herr Captain’s efforts to infuse some mirth
into it. Miss von Altdorf was apparently still
grief-stricken over her great-uncle’s sudden death,
and though she strove valiantly to smile at Lindenwald’s
essays at wit and to respond with some
animation to Grey’s less jocose but cheerful observations,
it was with such palpable exertion as
to rather discourage her would-be entertainers.</p>

<p>Her youth was a surprise to the American. At
first sight he had fancied her three or four-and-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>twenty,
but he was satisfied now that she could
not be more than eighteen. Her figure was distinctly
girlish.</p>

<p>She was all in white, from her great ostrich-plumed
hat of Leghorn straw to her tiny canvas
bottines, because, young as she was, she entertained
prejudices against conventional mourning, and
exercised them. It was a question, however,
whether in black or white she was more beautiful.
In the death-chamber Grey had seen her sombre-robed
and had pronounced her rarely lovely, and
now in raiment immaculately snowy she was
equally alluring. Her expression was naturally
pensive and her recent sorrow had given to her
big, deep-set, long-lashed blue eyes a pathos that
awoke the tenderest emotions. As the American
gazed at her across the table he experienced a
thrill of sentiment that was undeniable, and he
had but to glance at Lindenwald to see in his contemplation
the same fervency of soul.</p>

<p>“I should like it,” Grey said to her when the
dinner was about over and he was burning his
cognac over his coffee, “if you would take a trip
with me tomorrow into the country. We will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
start early and have <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i> at some inn, under
the trees. It will do you a world of good.”</p>

<p>Something very like a frown gathered on Lindenwald’s
brow, but it passed before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Do not forget my warning, Herr Arndt,” he
interjected. “It would perhaps be safer for me
to accompany Fraülein von Altdorf.”</p>

<p>“I will chance it,” Grey replied, decisively. “I
feel that I, too, need a little outing.”</p>

<p>“It will be lovely, Uncle Max,” the girl responded,
with more animation than she had previously
shown. “Let us go to Versailles. I have
never been, and I have read so much about it.”</p>

<p>“Versailles it shall be, my dear,” he answered,
lighting a cigarette, while Lindenwald brushed
his hand across his brow to hide a scowl.</p>

<p>Grey’s broken, unrefreshing, dreamful slumber
of the night before, followed by a tiresome, distressing
day, resulted early in the evening in a
drowsiness that he could not shake off. For a
while he dozed in a chair by an open window, but
when the clock had struck eleven he arose and
prepared for bed, and in a little while he was sleeping
soundly behind his blue velvet curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
The night, however, was warm and close after
the rain of the day, and, as the hours wore on, the
sleeper grew restless and turned uneasily from
side to side, by-and-by waking at each turning
and seeking a cool spot between the sheets. At
length sleep forsook him altogether, and he lay
quite wide awake peering into the darkness in an
effort to distinguish objects. But the night was
very black and the room was enveloped in a pall
of ink, save where the reflection from the street
lamps spread patches of dim yellow light on wall
and ceiling. The stillness, too, was oppressive.
The boulevard was dead, and within doors no
sound except the monotonous ticking of the clock
on the mantel-shelf was audible.</p>

<p>He waited longingly for the clock to strike that
he might know how many hours must elapse before
the dawn; and as he waited, his senses alert,
there broke softly on the silence the stealthy tread
of feet in the passage on the other side of the wall
near which he lay. No sooner had he heard the
footsteps than they ceased, and the sound was succeeded
by a muffled, metallic clicking from the
direction of his door. With Lindenwald’s warning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
in mind he had turned the key in the lock before
retiring, and he recalled this now with a sense
of satisfied security; but even as he did so he was
conscious of the door being pushed slowly but
creakingly ajar, and then the tread that he had
heard without he heard within. He held his breath,
not in affright, for he was, he realised, wonderfully
composed, but lest he scare away the intruder
before the object of his visit was made plain.</p>

<p>Another second and a figure had crossed in the
dim light that came from one of the windows. It
was a rather undersized figure, Grey thought, but
its attitude was crouching, almost creeping, and
he might be deceived. Quickly a hand went to
the cord loops at either side of the casements
and dropped the curtains, and now the room
was devoid of even the dim illumination from
the street lamps. Then again, for a heart-beat,
there was a blade of light visible as the
visitor’s arm shot quickly between the lowered
window hangings and drew cautiously together
the open sashes, first one and then the other.</p>

<p>The steps now approached the bed—very
slowly, haltingly, as though the intruder stopped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
at each footfall to listen. Grey waited, with every
muscle tense, his nerves a-strain, wondering, speculating
as to this night prowler’s next move. For
a little while his approach ceased and the suspense
grew maddening. The man had evidently halted
in the centre of the room. Then there came the
faintest tinkle of glass touched to glass, so faint
that the ticking of the clock made question whether
it was not imagination; and then the stealthy
stepping was resumed, but more nearly silent than
before, until the man in the bed, with heart pounding,
teeth shut tight and breath indrawn and held,
knew that the other was there beside him—leaning
in over him, between the curtains, with a hand
outstretched....</p>

<p>Blindly, into the pitch dark, with all its power
of nerve and muscle, Grey’s clenched fist shot upward
just as a cloth, wet with a liquid so suffocatingly
volatile as to stagger him for the instant,
dropped on his face. He heard a startled cry, half
moan, half groan, and then a crash as a body reeled
backward and, losing its balance, toppled over a
chair. On his feet in a flash, Grey made haste to
follow up his advantage. His foot touched his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
fallen assailant and he flung his full weight down
upon him, groping wildly in the dark to find his
arms and pinion them. But the fellow wriggled
like a worm—twisting agilely, squirming from
under his clutch—and his arms evaded capture.
Locked in a desperate embrace they rolled over
and over, now half rising to their knees, now
thrown back again, upsetting tables and chairs,
pounding their heads stunningly on floor and wall,
clutching at each other’s hair, gripping each
other’s throats—a wrestling match in which
science had neither time nor place; a struggle for
capture on the part of one, and for escape on the
part of the other.</p>

<p>Grey was the stronger of the two, the heavier,
the more muscular, but his foe was all elasticity,
wiry, resilient, untiring, indomitable. The minutes
passed without any apparent advantage to
either. The smaller man was swearing in four
languages and Grey was breathing hard. The
noise they were making, as they rose and fell and
overturned furniture, was thunderous. Each
moment Grey expected the house would be awakened
and assistance would arrive. Perspiration was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
pouring from his every pore; his pyjamas were
in ribbons, his body and limbs half naked. Vainly
he strove to strike and stun his adversary. His
blows were dodged as if by instinct and his
knuckles were bleeding where they had come in
contact with the floor.</p>

<p>At length he succeeded in laying hold of the
fellow’s face, his nose and mouth in his iron grasp,
but instantly the jaws wrenched open and then
closed savagely with Grey’s finger between viciously
incisive teeth. A cry of pain escaped him
as for the smallest moment a wave of faintness
swept over him, and then he felt his antagonist
slipping sinuously from under him and he grabbed
wildly for a fresh hold. He caught a wrist and
tried to cling to it, but the teeth were cutting
to the bone, grinding on the joint, and the wrist
slid through his grasp and the head followed in a
twinkling. He rolled over and lunged out again,
but the steely jaws had at that instant released his
mangled finger, and even as he was striving to
reach, struggling pantingly to his knees, he heard
the door open quickly and he knew that he was
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
He sank back to a sitting posture, breathing
hard and deeply, but the air seemed suddenly to
have grown thick and foul and choking, and he
clambered to his feet and sought in the darkness
for a window. Presently the touch of the curtains
rewarded him. He thrust them frantically aside,
pushed open the sashes and then dropped down
again with his head and shoulders far out over the
balcony, drinking in the cool, fresh air of the very
early morning.</p>

<p>And it was here, in this position, a minute later
that Johann, who had after considerable deliberation
decided to investigate the cause of the disturbance,
found him pale and exhausted, with the
remnants of his pyjamas spattered with blood
from his bleeding finger.</p>

<p>“Oh, Herr Arndt,” he cried, in perturbation,
“what has happened? Have you tried to kill
yourself? Oh, it is suffocating here! The gas—the
room is full of gas.”</p>

<p>Johann helped Grey to his feet, sat him in a
chair by the window, and having discovered the
four gas jets of the chandelier which depended
from the ceiling in the centre of the room turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
full on, he turned them off, opened the other window
and threw wide the door to effect a draft.
Then he lighted the candles and returned to make
an inventory of his master’s injuries.</p>

<p>“I’m not very much hurt, Johann,” Grey
assured him; “but it was a pretty tough scrimmage
while it lasted, and the brute did give my
finger a biting. He had teeth like a saw and jaws
like a vise. His original idea was asphyxiation,
I suppose. He fancied I was asleep and that he
would make it my last. By the way, look in the
bed over there. You’ll find a chloroformed handkerchief,
I think.”</p>

<p>“And was it for robbery, do you imagine, Herr
Arndt, that he came?” Johann asked, as he went
toward the bed.</p>

<p>“God knows,” Grey answered. “It looks
rather professional when a fellow unlocks your
door with a pair of nippers. The key was in the
lock, you see.”</p>

<p>“You did not see his face, Herr Arndt? You
would not know him?”</p>

<p>“I’m not a cat, Johann, and I cannot see in the
dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Then the valet hastened away to investigate,
but returned without any information worth the
calling. He had aroused the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> only to learn
that the street door had not been opened in two
hours either for ingress or egress. Whoever the
depredator was he must either have come in early
and remained hidden or have entered through
some unbarred window in the rear of the hotel,
probably escaping by the same means. Having
made his report Johann bathed and bound Grey’s
finger, drew a bath for him, got out clean nightwear,
remade the bed, and, just as the clock struck
the half-hour after four, left him once more alone,
still with the chloroformed handkerchief in his
hand, which he was examining carefully for the
third time. But it was merely a square piece of
fine hemstitched linen without any distinguishing
mark whatever. In that, certainly, there was no
clue to his visitor.</p>

<p>But just as he was about to blow out his candles
his foot trod on something hard, and he stooped
and picked up a seal ring. It was very heavy and
richly chased, and it bore an elaborately engraved
coat of arms. In that last despairing clutch at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
fellow’s hand he had evidently stripped this from
his finger—this which could not but prove damaging
evidence of his identity. The heraldic device
was to Grey unfamiliar, but it would be a
comparatively easy matter to learn to what family
it belonged. Indeed, he had a vague recollection
of having noticed a ring of this pattern on the little
finger of Baron von Einhard’s ungloved hand the
afternoon before in the hotel reading-room; but
the pattern was not uncommon, and— but it was
preposterous to fancy that a man of his position,
no matter what Lindenwald had said, no matter
what his reputation for chicanery, craft, and cunning,
would personally undertake a deliberate
attempt at homicide. Such impossible characters
might figure in melodramas, but in real life they
were out of the question. And then he looked at
the ring again, turning it over and inspecting it
very minutely in the light of the candle flame.</p>

<p>Captain Lindenwald, when he was told of the
affair, was quite sure it was von Einhard even
before he was shown the ring, and when that was
forthcoming he was willing to swear to it. The
arms, he declared, were the von Einhard arms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and the ring could have been worn by no one save
the Baron himself. He was for putting the matter
in the hands of the police and thus avoiding future
dangers, but after a little deliberation he realised
that such a course would be impracticable. For
the present it was absolutely necessary, he knew,
to reveal nothing as to his and his charge’s whereabouts.
Too much was known already; and general
publicity, even though it put von Einhard
where he could do no personal harm, would more
greatly imperil the carrying out of the plans that
were indispensable.</p>

<p>This, at least, was the impression he conveyed
to Grey, though he was, as usual, most guarded in
his choice of words. Never yet, the American observed,
had he directly spoken of his mission, nor
had he once so much as intimated to him that he
knew him as other than Herr Max Arndt. That
he was a crown prince <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> to the bedside of
his dying sire Captain Lindenwald had zealously
refrained from uttering save to a third party
under stress of unusual circumstance, and then in
a tone so low that he could not reasonably be expected
to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
“If I may be permitted,” the Captain requested,
“I will keep this ring for a little. I may run
across von Einhard, and I should like to give him
this one hint that his attempt on your life is known
to us.”</p>

<p>But for some reason which he could not define
Grey demurred.</p>

<p>“I have a whim to wear it,” he said, replacing
it upon his finger; and Lindenwald made no further
plea.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was deemed best not to mention the incident
of the night to Miss von Altdorf,
and on their way to the Gare St. Lazare
that morning Grey accounted for his bandaged
finger by the subterfuge of having caught
it in a door. He was not altogether satisfied
with the spot chosen for the day’s outing.
Had he been allowed unaided to make the choice
he would undoubtedly have selected a resort of
quite different character, but the girl had expressed
a wish to visit Louis XIV’s “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Abîme des dépenses</i>,”
and he had without demur acceded to her desire.
After all, to be alone with her and thus gather
from her knowledge as much information as possible
concerning the mystery that surrounded him
was his prime object, and for this purpose Versailles
offered as propitious a background as Bougival
or Croissy or a dozen other places that he
personally would have preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
The day, washed clear and brilliant by the rain
of yesterday, was not uncomfortably warm, and,
though the maimed finger ached distractingly at
times, Grey, in spite of his misgivings, found the
little jaunt delightfully diverting. The Fraülein
had shaken off much of her melancholy of the previous
evening, and her mood was cheerful, if not
merry. Her appreciation, which was mingled
with a joyousness almost childish, was especially
gratifying to her companion. Everything she
saw interested her, and her comment, while invariably
intelligent, was so unaffected and ingenuous
as to be ofttimes amusing.</p>

<p>When, after <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i> at the Café de la Comédie,
they had come out upon the terrace of the
palace and stood overlooking the quaint, solemn,
old-fashioned gardens, cut up into squares and
triangles and parallelograms and ornamented with
statues and vases and fountains arranged with
monotonously geometric precision, her face shone
with pleasure for a moment and then a shadow
crossed it.</p>

<p>“Are all landscape gardeners atheists?” she
asked, naïvely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
“I’m sure I don’t know,” Grey replied, smiling;
“I’ve never investigated their religious beliefs.”</p>

<p>“Well, the one who designed all this,” she
added, with a sweep of her hand, “had very little
respect for God’s taste.”</p>

<p>And later, as they sauntered through room after
room and gallery after gallery of the palace, with
their interminable succession of paintings and
sculptures, she was much impressed by the pictured
ceilings.</p>

<p>“I wonder why they put their best work where
one must break one’s neck to see it?” she queried;
and then she laughed. “Do you suppose it was to
encourage the kings and queens and other
grandees to bear in mind their exalted position
and to hold their heads high?”</p>

<p>Grey had thus far refrained from broaching the
subject which had inspired the excursion. He had
chosen first of all to study the girl and gauge her
character. Over her presence in the little party of
questionables in which he had so unexpectedly
found himself he was much perplexed. It seemed
scarcely reasonable to suppose that she was not in
some way involved in the plot, but whether actively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
or passively, with knowledge or without,
was, or at least might be, open to question. He
certainly could gather no indication from her attitude,
her manner, or her utterance that she was
other than artless and sincere. She appeared, in
fact, uncommonly simple-hearted, straightforward,
and guileless, and, after weighing the evidence,
he reached the conclusion that if she had a
place in the scheme of his enemies it was most
assuredly without her ken or connivance. It was
nevertheless clear that she must be innocently
aware of much that he wished eagerly to know,
and, as they wandered over the palace together,
from the sumptuously decorated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Salles des Croisades</i>,
reflecting in picture, trophy and souvenir
the conquest of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre,
to the magnificent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Galerie des Glaces</i>, with its
many high-arched windows and glittering, gilt-niched
mirrors, he ponderingly strove to outline
some course of procedure that would yield him
what he desired and yet not reveal his own delicately
fragile position.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until they had finished
their inspection of the palace and had passed out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
into the gardens by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cour des Princes</i> that an
opportunity offered to make trial of the plan he
had conceived. They had strolled under the
orange trees beside that long stretch of velvet
lawn towards what is known as the basin of
Apollo and had found seats on the marble coping
of the fountain. As they sat there facing each
other amid the perfume of the flowers and the
spice of the shrubbery, the balmy breath of summer
fanning their cheeks and the genial glow of
a tempered June sun bathing them, the girl’s eye
fell for the first time upon the ring on Grey’s little
finger, and she gave an involuntary start of surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it you, then?” she cried, and there was
something of awe in her voice, though her eyes
were smiling. “But no,” she added, quickly, “that
cannot be. I do not understand, Uncle Max.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, child,” Grey replied, smiling back at
her. He had not observed her glance, and her
exclamation had startled him. She took his hand
in her long, white, rose-tipped fingers and held it
up before his eyes, the ring glinting in the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
“That!” she said. “What does it mean, your
wearing it?”</p>

<p>“Mean?” he hesitated, wondering. “Why
should it mean anything? Has not a gentleman
a right to wear a ring if his fancy runs that
way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course; some rings; but no ordinary
gentleman has a right to wear that one.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I am not an ordinary gentleman?”
he pursued. “Suppose I have a title and
bear arms, have I not a right to engrave those
arms upon gold and wear them on my finger?”</p>

<p>She looked at him very seriously from out her
deep-set, long-lashed eyes of purplish blue, and
then she said:</p>

<p>“But it is the ring of the Crown Prince. And
you are not the Crown Prince. If you were you
could not be my uncle.”</p>

<p>Grey’s heart leaped. His decision had been confirmed.
She was not trying to put him on a throne
to which he had no more right than those workmen
who were repairing the stone margin of the
great canal a hundred yards away. Yet, at the
same time, she had filled him with a new perplexity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
It was evident that the ring was quite
familiar to her. Therefore it could hardly be von
Einhard’s, and Lindenwald’s assertion must not
only have been false but knowingly false, and with
an object. If the Fraülein von Altdorf knew the
ring as the Crown Prince’s ring, Lindenwald must
also have known it as such. It was for that reason
he did not wish Grey to keep it. He feared, probably,
just such a revelation as had come about.
These points were plain enough, but the whole
intricate problem was growing more and more
involved. Its likeness to a maze again recurred.
With every effort to extricate himself he seemed
to get further and more bewilderingly entangled.
And once more he was tempted to leave the path,
which seemed to turn and turn again on itself, and
to cut his way through thicket and underbrush
regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>“What a wise Fraülein it is!” he replied, after
a pause. “What you say is very true. If I am
the Crown Prince I am not your uncle, and if I
am your uncle I am not the Crown Prince. Now
which would you prefer to have me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for your sake,” she answered, quickly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
“I’d rather you were heir to the throne; but for
my sake I’d rather you were my uncle.”</p>

<p>“But not being able to be both, suppose you
should learn that I am neither?” he queried,
laughing.</p>

<p>“But you are,” she protested, with conviction.
“You are my uncle, that is a fact.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Grey asked. The situation
was growing interesting; disclosures were
imminent, and they were coming quite naturally
without his having had to resort to the plan he
had mapped out.</p>

<p>“How does one ever know such things?” she
replied, a little annoyance in her tone. “You were
my Great-uncle Schlippenbach’s nephew and I am
your niece. I call you Uncle Max and you call
me Minna.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, that is very true,” Grey went on,
banteringly, and he remembered what O’Hara had
told him of how they had met in London a week
after his setting foot on English soil; “but you
never saw me in your life until two months ago.
Do you remember how we first met?”</p>

<p>“I have a very vivid recollection of it. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
at dinner at the Folsonham, in London. I wore
a pale green frock. And poor Great-uncle Schlippenbach
said: ‘Minna, my dear, this is your
Uncle Max, who hasn’t seen you since you were a
baby.’”</p>

<p>“And what else did he say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t remember all the conversation.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about where we were
going, and what we were going for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he said anything then. But you
must remember. You were as much there as I
was.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I was not listening,” Grey pleaded,
his eyes a-twinkle. “I had something better
to do.”</p>

<p>“What was that, pray?”</p>

<p>“I had my pretty niece to look at.”</p>

<p>The rose in Minna’s cheeks deepened and her
eyes fell shyly.</p>

<p>“Now you are teasing me again,” she said.</p>

<p>Grey turned an uninterested gaze for a brief
space on the sun-god and his chariot which, surrounded
by tritons, nymphs, and dolphins, rose in
heroic proportions from the centre of the basin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
“I never knew much of my Uncle Schlippenbach,”
he ventured, after a little; “tell me about
him.”</p>

<p>“You should know more than I,” the Fraülein
returned. “You were in New York with him
while I was in England.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” her companion went on, as he
took a cigarette from his case and struck a match,
“but I don’t mean intimately, personally. Tell
me a little of his history.”</p>

<p>“Everybody knew he was eccentric.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise he would never have left Budavia.
Just think of what he gave up!”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” Grey interposed, eagerly.
“What did he give up? I’ve heard stories, to be
sure, but I don’t know that I ever had the truth
of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve heard it a hundred times,” Minna
responded, digging the point of her parasol into
the gravel. “You see, he was tutor to the Court.
He had taught King Frederic about all there was
to teach, and when His Majesty outgrew school
books—of course he wasn’t His Majesty then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
but His Royal Highness the Crown Prince—Great-uncle
Schlippenbach accompanied him on
the grand tour. They visited every court in
Europe and then went over to Africa and Turkey
in Asia, and I don’t know where else. Then when
Frederic succeeded to the throne, Great-uncle
Schlippenbach was still retained, and after a while,
when a little prince was born to Queen Anna, he
was constituted a sort of kindergarten-professor
to the royal infant.”</p>

<p>“In other words, a mental wet-nurse,” suggested
Grey.</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly. I think he taught him to say
‘bah’ and ‘boo’ and ‘gee-gee’ and ‘moo-cow’—or
rather their German equivalents—and led
him gloriously on to the alphabet. Then, just as
he was beginning to spell nicely in words of three
letters, something happened. Nobody ever knew
just exactly what it was, but Great-uncle Schlippenbach
took offence. Her Majesty, Queen Anna,
it seems, was to blame. He brooded over the
matter for weeks and months, growing more and
more incensed, more and more bitter. In vain
King Frederic tried to mollify him. He was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
fond of Great-uncle Schlippenbach, and he wanted
to smooth matters over, but the royal tutor was
not to be pacified. He broke out in a torrent of
rage, recounting his fancied wrongs and declaring
that he had wasted the best years of his life in a
hopeless effort to grow flowers of intellect from
barren soil. The German Emperor would have
had him behind the bars for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lèse-majesté</i>, but King
Frederic only laughed and offered him a baronetcy.
But Great-uncle Schlippenbach scorned the
offer. Having spoken his mind, he packed his
boxes and left the Court, left Kürschdorf, left
Budavia, left Europe and went to America to
begin life anew. That was twenty-five years ago,
and he was forty years old.”</p>

<p>“And the poor little Crown Prince had to learn
his words of four letters from someone less gifted,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Dear only knows from whom he ever did
learn them,” Miss von Altdorf continued. “He
disappeared the very next week after Great-uncle
Schlippenbach.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared?” repeated Grey.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you remember that, surely. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
abducted, you know. Why, that’s a part of the
history of your own country. That’s why there’s
so much excitement now over rumours of his turning
up at this late day. Oh, dear, Uncle Max,
why will you tease me so? You made me tell you
that whole story, and I’m sure you knew it quite
as well as I.”</p>

<p>Grey laughed joyously.</p>

<p>“I love to hear you talk,” he told her, his gaze
lingering fondly on her blushing face. “And so,”
he added, “they are looking for the kidnapped
baby to reappear a man and claim his own? Is
that it?”</p>

<p>But she was silent, her eyes downcast.</p>

<p>“Won’t you answer me?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“I won’t again tell you what you already
know,” she answered, a little petulantly.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know about this ring, really,” Grey
urged. “Tell me about it. What has it got to
do with the stolen Crown Prince?”</p>

<p>Minna looked up, regarding him searchingly.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I found it,” he answered, quite truthfully.</p>

<p>“In a jewel casket, within a great iron chest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
inside an ordinary travelling box?” she cross-questioned.</p>

<p>The significance of the description was not lost
on her hearer.</p>

<p>“No,” he returned, frankly, “not in anything
at all. On the floor of my room.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were round with surprise.</p>

<p>“And how did it come there?”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine. That is why I’d like you
to tell me what you know of it.”</p>

<p>“And before you found it on the floor of your
room you had never seen it?”</p>

<p>“Never. I swear it by the sun-god yonder.”</p>

<p>“My great-uncle never showed it to you—never
told you of it?”</p>

<p>“Never,” Grey repeated.</p>

<p>“He showed it to me in London,” she confessed,
reaching out for the finger it adorned, “and
told me all about it. It seems that when he left
Budavia it had in some way got in with his effects.
He did not find it until a year or more afterward.
It had belonged to the King before his coronation,
and to his father before him, and to his grandfather
before that. The arms are those of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Prince of Kronfeld. The Crown Prince is always,
you know, the Prince of Kronfeld.”</p>

<p>“And as the little Prince of Kronfeld had been
kidnapped and Uncle Schlippenbach did not know
where to find him, he simply put the ring away
for safe-keeping, eh?” asked Grey, quizzically.</p>

<p>“He was taking it back to Kürschdorf when he
died,” Minna answered, with rebuke in her tone.
“As soon as he heard that the Crown Prince had
been found he started. He wished, he said, to put
it on his finger with his own hand. ‘His Royal
Highness will probably travel <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>,’ he said
to me, ‘but I shall know him; and when we meet
I shall give him the ring. When you see it worn
you will know that the wearer is the Crown
Prince.’”</p>

<p>“And when you saw it on my finger you
thought—just for a moment—that I was he, didn’t
you, Minna? But then, as I am your uncle I cannot
be the Prince of Kronfeld, so we will take it
off and wear it no more,” Grey concluded, slipping
the golden circlet from his finger and stowing it
away in a pocket of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“But what I should like to know,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the Fraülein, “is how it came on the floor of your
room?”</p>

<p>“And so should I,” her companion echoed;
“how it got out of the casket, and the iron chest,
and the travelling box.”</p>

<p>Presently the sound of many shuffling feet was
borne to their ears, accompanied by the discordant
piping of high-pitched voices, and turning their
heads they saw approaching an army of tourists
with a gesticulating, haranguing guide in the
lead.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of ‘follow the man from Cook’s,’”
Grey observed, annoyed at having their privacy
invaded. “We had better stroll on.”</p>

<p>They walked rapidly for a while, keeping always
to the right, until they were out of sight and
sound of the disturbing company, and then they
dawdled from terrace to terrace; leaned over
lichen-stained marble balustrades to see their
reflections in the dark, silent pools; loitered
on banks of mossy turf beneath the shade of towering
trees; stopped to admire, to criticise, and
not infrequently to laugh over the sculptures that
dotted the way, and came out at length upon an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
avenue, long and straight and level and gleaming
white in the afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>“You want to see the Trianons, of course,”
Grey suggested to the girl. “I know you are
familiar with many of the events that took place
there.”</p>

<p>And so, turning to the left, they sauntered on
until they came to the one-story horse-shoe shaped
villa that Louis XIV built for Madame de Maintenon.
But Minna was tired of sight-seeing, and
the porcelains and the pictures proved alike uninteresting.
The Petit Trianon pleased her much
better because of its associations with Marie Antoinette,
who had been one of her school-girl heroines,
and over its delightful English-looking garden
she grew enthusiastic.</p>

<p>They strolled along the winding paths, dallied
on the shore of the funny little artificial lake, and
rested for a while in the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Temple de l’Amour</i>.”
The number of visitors, however, was to both of
them a disturbing influence. They would have
liked the place to themselves, but they were at
every turn running into couples and parties whose
presence, as Grey put it, “spoiled the picture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
They had just emerged from that group of
homely, quaint cottages in a far corner of the
garden where the fair ladies of Louis’s Court were
wont to play at peasant life, when the rippling
laughter of women and the more hearty if less
musical merriment of men broke jarringly upon
their hearing.</p>

<p>“Can’t we have some milk at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vacherie
Suisse</i>?” Grey heard a woman’s voice ask in the
English of the well-bred.</p>

<p>And then a man rejoined:</p>

<p>“Milk! What for? There’s still an unopened
case of champagne in the coach.”</p>

<p>Again the laughter echoed, but nearer. The
little company were coming towards them, hidden
by the shrubbery. A second later and they came
into view—a tall, large woman with brilliant auburn
hair, in gown and hat of pale lavender; a
middle-aged man, red-faced and well-groomed; a
dainty little dark woman, all in red, with a tall,
dark man in grey, and then—Grey went white as
the whitest cloud overhead, for Hope Van Tuyl
was approaching, and with her was the young
man from the Embassy whom he had seen yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
at the hotel. And there was Frothingham,
too, whom he had not recognised at first glance;
and it was Nicholas Van Tuyl, he saw now, who
was with the red-haired woman in the lead.</p>

<p>For a second he halted, undecided, a powerful
impulse urging him to speak to the woman he
loved, at all hazards. His lips were framing
words, his eyes were beaming, his hand was half
way to his hat, before his judgment came to the
rescue—and held him; told him that it would be
folly, that now as never before it was his duty to
maintain his disguise and thereby eventually establish
his innocence. His eyes cooled, his teeth
closed on his embryo utterance, his hand dropped
to his side.</p>

<p>“Carey Grey!”</p>

<p>Hope’s voice rang out suddenly above the babble
of the party. She had seen him and recognised
him. The others had passed on. Only she and
Edson were there beside him. With an effort that
cost him the most poignant torture he ever suffered
he turned to Minna, murmuring words that had
no meaning and walked heedlessly by.</p>

<p>Edson caught Miss Van Tuyl’s trembling arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
“Sh!” he warned, a little excitedly; “you’ve
made a mistake. That isn’t Grey.”</p>

<p>“But”—and the colour came and went in her
face and she breathed quickly—“but I know it is.
I know him, I’m sure; oh, quite, quite sure. I
cannot be mistaken. His hair is changed; yes,
and he has a beard, but his eyes—I should always
know his eyes; and”—as she stood gazing after
him—“his shoulders. There isn’t another man
in the world who has shoulders just like Carey
Grey’s.”</p>

<p>“No other man, possibly,” added Edson, “except
the Crown Prince of Budavia.”</p>

<h2><a id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">On</span> the way back to Paris Grey’s thoughtful
silence contrasted so markedly
with his cheery loquacity of the morning
that Fraülein von Altdorf was led
to observe:</p>

<p>“I do believe you’re tired, Uncle Max.”</p>

<p>“Tired?” he repeated, forcing a smile. “No,
my child, not a bit. The day has been a joy. I’ve
revelled in it. Tired! The idea! Am I a septuagenarian
or am I an invalid?”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t spoken for fifteen whole
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I, really? I suppose I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“Of what?” she asked, mischievously.</p>

<p>Grey hesitated a little moment.</p>

<p>“Of fortune and misfortune,” he answered,
gravely; “of Fate and the pranks she plays; of
life and its inconsistencies; of right and wrong
and rewards and punishments; of love and hatred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and jealousy; of fair women and brutal, selfish
men; of a hundred and one things more or less interesting
and absorbing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <em>were</em> busy!” the girl exclaimed. “I
don’t wonder you didn’t hear my question. Altogether
I have asked it three times.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he pleaded contritely;
“that was very rude of me. Won’t you ask it
once more?”</p>

<p>They had a compartment to themselves and
were seated opposite each other. The train had
just left Asnières and was crossing the Seine.</p>

<p>“I was wondering whether you noticed the
lady we passed in the garden of the Petit Trianon.
I don’t believe you did.”</p>

<p>“We passed many ladies,” Grey temporised;
“I can’t say that I noticed them all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but this one was very beautiful,” she insisted.
“She had such colouring and such lovely
brown eyes, and I think she thought she recognised
you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me at the time?” he
asked, striving to appear unconscious.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I? That’s a nice question. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
nudged you and I tried to catch your eye; and,
after we had gone on a few steps I begged you to
look back, but you wouldn’t heed me. Oh, you
were thinking very hard just then. Was it about
fair ladies and brutal, selfish men, do you
imagine?”</p>

<p>“Probably,” Grey answered. “I’m sorry I was
so rude.” And once more he relapsed into meditative
silence.</p>

<p>Very bitter indeed was his self-condemnation.
If he could have had a second more in which to
make his decision he would have decided differently.
Of that he was sure. It may have been
that he took the course of wisdom, but wisdom
and love have been enemies since time began, and
where his allegiance was due there he had proved
traitor. He contrasted his selfishness with her
loyalty, and his ready willingness to conclude that
she believed ill of him with her now proved steadfastness,
even to the disregard of place and circumstance.
He had metaphorically given her a
curse for a caress, and he mentally and emotionally
scourged himself for his brutality. The suggestion
that desperate ills require desperate remedies—that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
it was necessary to be cruel that he
might be kind—presented itself, but he refused
to admit that it had any application. He was
consumed by a desire to make reparation, to wipe
out this blot of cowardice with some recklessly
bold bit of bravery. He would go to her hotel—the
Van Tuyls always stopped at the Ritz—and
regardless of consequences he would present himself,
explain all, and, in abject abasement, beseech
her pardon. This, he argued, was the very least
he could do. But when he reached this conclusion
doubts assailed him and robbed him of what little
peace he had garnered. Would she receive him?
What right had he to expect that she could permit
him to speak to her, now that he had repulsed her—cut
her in the presence of her friends and further
insulted and humiliated her by appearing
more than interested in another woman—and a
very young and very pretty woman, too? He most
assuredly could have no just cause for complaint
should she adopt such an attitude. She had indicated
clearly enough that as long as only newspaper
reports were his accusers she was willing
to await his side of the story, but when she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
given him an opportunity to defend himself, and
he had chosen to ignore it and herself as well, was
it in reason to hope for any further forbearance?</p>

<p>It was in this mood that Grey’s return from
Versailles was accomplished; in this ill-temper
with himself and this doubt of being able to undo
what he looked on as a more dire menace to his
happiness than all the charges of defalcation and
embezzlement and all the dangers of extradition.</p>

<p>When at length he and Miss von Altdorf
reached the Hôtel Grammont they found O’Hara
awaiting them. He came running out to the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiacre</i> and gave a hand to the young woman, assisting
her to alight.</p>

<p>“Where on earth have you been?” he asked,
smiling; but Grey caught a note of concern in his
voice.</p>

<p>“To Versailles, for the day,” the Fraülein answered,
gaily. “And oh, such a lovely day, too!
I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they tell you?” Grey asked. “Lindenwald
knew.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him.”</p>

<p>“Johann knew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
“I haven’t seen Johann either.”</p>

<p>It was not until the two men were together in
Grey’s room that O’Hara broke his news.</p>

<p>“They’ve cleared out,” he said, bluntly. “What
do you think of that for a rum go?”</p>

<p>Grey, who had been drawing off his gloves,
stopped midway in the process.</p>

<p>“Cleared out!” he repeated, in astonishment.
“Who have cleared out? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The whole crew,” declared O’Hara, “Lindenwald
and Lutz and Johann. I understood at first
that you and the Fraülein had gone with them,
but the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> told me that you and she had
started earlier and that your traps were still here.”</p>

<p>“But they?” Grey pursued, eagerly. “Where
have they gone? Did they leave no word?”</p>

<p>“Devil a word,” returned the Irishman.
“They paid their bill—that is, the Captain did—and
departed, kit and all.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>Grey drew off his other glove.</p>

<p>“They’re frightened,” he decided; “they have
grown suspicious. They never knew at what minute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
they would be pounced on. Their plot was
clear enough. What they wanted to do was to
palm me off as the Crown Prince of Budavia and
put me on the throne when the King dies, as he is
going to, if he has not already.”</p>

<p>“What rot!” exclaimed O’Hara. “Have you
gone clean daft? What would be their object?
How could they hope to do it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about their object,”
Grey continued, calmly; “that’s still a puzzle to
me; but they might hope for a lot with me in the
condition I was in a few days ago. I apparently
did their bidding to their utmost satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“It’s very improbable,” the Irishman insisted;
“you’ll never be able to make any one believe
it.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I?” the American demanded. “Well,
then, wait and see. I’ve learned a lot since I
saw you last. As much as I’ve told you is very
plain. I have witnesses to prove it. And the
other proofs—my God! What do you suppose has
become of that box at the Gare du Nord? I sent
Lutz for the check or receipt last night, and he
never brought it. And this ring!” he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
talking more to himself than to his companion,
“it was in that box. Of course it was. And—”
He ceased speaking—his thoughts were coming
now too rapidly for words—and stood with lips
pressed and eyelids drawn, gazing through his
lashes into space.</p>

<p>He was satisfied that someone—he suspected it
was Lutz—had got the box from the railway station,
had rifled it, had abstracted the ring, had
made so bold as to wear it. Yes, when Lutz had
come in answer to his summons of the previous
evening, he was wearing it even then. It must
have been too large for him. He had been nervous,
his hands had been twitching, and it had
dropped from his finger, and—but no; could it
be possible? Was it—<em>was</em> it Lutz who had returned
in the early morning with intent to smother
him? Was it he with whom he had wrestled?
Was it from his hand that he had stripped this
heirloom of the Budavian Court? And Lindenwald’s
assurance that it bore the von Einhard
arms? What could that mean, other than that
Lindenwald was in league with Lutz and striving
to shield him? And now their flight....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
“Will you kindly tell me whether you are subject
to these attacks?” asked O’Hara, interrupting
his train of thought. “If I’m to be your lieutenant
and serve in your campaign, it strikes me
that I should have your full and entire confidence,
and yet you are keeping something from me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you everything after dinner,” Grey
consented. “We’ll have a council of war and we’ll
map out a plan of action.”</p>

<p>When O’Hara had run away to dress, promising
to meet Grey and the Fraülein in a private
room of the Café Riche at seven-thirty and dine
with them, the American’s thoughts reverted to
his resolution to see Hope Van Tuyl at all hazards.
The disappearance of Lindenwald and the others,
however, had again somewhat altered the situation.
It was now more than ever necessary that
he retain his freedom in order to track and run
down the fugitives, and he recognised the risk he
took in going to a hotel patronised largely by
Americans and sending up a card bearing his real
name. Once more his judgment was in the ascendency—wisdom
had gained a slight advantage over
the little blind god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Sitting down at his table Grey took up a pen
and wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Darling</span>: For the last two hours I have been in
purgatory. What must you think of me? I would come
to you at once if I could, but it is impossible. Tomorrow
morning, though, I must see you. At the end of the
Tuileries gardens, near the Place de la Concorde, there
is, you may remember, a grove of trees. Arrange to be
there with your maid at eleven o’clock. There will be
few there at that hour.</p></blockquote>

<p>This he despatched to the Ritz by messenger.</p>

<p>“Fancy Captain Lindenwald going off!” cried
Minna, as, promptly at twenty minutes past seven,
she joined Grey in the drawing-room. “Where
has he gone, do you suppose? And Lutz, too,
and even Johann.”</p>

<p>“They’ve gone to the seaside over Sunday,”
was Grey’s jesting reply. “Paris was getting too
warm for them.”</p>

<p>“But,” she protested, at fault, “I understood
we were all to start for Kürschdorf tomorrow
night.”</p>

<p>“Were we? Who said so?”</p>

<p>“Captain Lindenwald, last evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Lindenwald has changed his
plans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
“It is certainly very mysterious,” she concluded,
perplexedly. “I couldn’t believe it when
the chambermaid told me.” And the great solemn
eyes were graver than usual.</p>

<p>When, after dinner, they returned to the hotel,
Grey’s glance detected a telegram in the rack addressed
to the decamping Captain and he made
haste to appropriate it. A little later, in his room,
he handed it to O’Hara.</p>

<p>“It may be of service,” he said, significantly.
“I don’t much like prying into another man’s
affairs, but in this case his and mine are, in a way,
identical.”</p>

<p>The Irishman nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep it until you’ve told me all you know
without it,” he suggested, taking out a briarwood
pipe and filling it, “so drive ahead, lad, and don’t
omit any details.”</p>

<p>And then Grey told his story, beginning with
the glimpse of von Einhard, on the Boulevard St.
Martin; following with the visit of Edson and the
overheard announcement that he, Grey, was the
Crown Prince Maximilian; the reappearance of
the Baron; Lutz’s suspicious demeanour; the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
on his life; the finding of the ring; the
ring’s history; and, finally, his own deductions.</p>

<p>O’Hara listened attentively, blowing great
clouds of smoke from under his red moustache.
Occasionally he interrupted with a question. When
the recital was concluded he got up and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>“Well done, man,” he exclaimed; “you have
been making hay in sun and rain alike. I wonder
if we could lay our hands on this Baron von Einhard.
It seems to me that he is just the chap we
want to make friends with.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he is still hanging about,” the
American replied; “he probably has not lost sight
of me. I’d know him if I saw him again. We’ll
have a look in at the cafés a little later. And now
about Lindenwald and the others. Didn’t the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> know which way they went?”</p>

<p>“No, they hailed a couple of passing <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiacres</i>,
and he didn’t hear what directions were given.”</p>

<p>Grey tore open the telegram which O’Hara had
tossed onto the table. It was dated Kürschdorf.
“The King is dead,” it read; “wire when you
will be here,” and it was signed, “Ritter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
He pushed it across to the Irishman, remarking:</p>

<p>“He probably had that news from some other
source before he left.”</p>

<p>“You think it hastened him?”</p>

<p>“In a way, yes. At least it directed him,” Grey
said, with conviction.</p>

<p>O’Hara looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You surely don’t imagine the three of them
have gone to Kürschdorf?” he blurted, in a tone
of surprise.</p>

<p>“I do mean that exactly.”</p>

<p>“But why there, of all places? If Lindenwald
is expected to bring the Crown Prince with him
he surely wouldn’t go there empty-handed. What
excuses could he make?”</p>

<p>“I don’t pretend to conjecture his excuses,”
Grey replied, smiling, “but it seems very clear to
me that Kürschdorf is his only sanctuary. There
he will be with friends. Whatever he says is likely
to be believed. If he fled elsewhere he would be
in constant danger of arrest. His very flight
would be evidence of his guilt.”</p>

<p>O’Hara nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
“You’re probably right,” he acquiesced; “anyway
he turned he had to take chances, and
Kürschdorf must have looked to him the least
dangerous. What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Follow him,” Grey answered, promptly.
“Take the Orient Express tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>“And once we are there; what then?”</p>

<p>“The Crown Prince claims the throne.”</p>

<p>O’Hara put down his pipe and sat staring in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Claims the throne?” he repeated, “the Crown
Prince?”</p>

<p>“The Crown Prince claims the throne.” Grey
reiterated it with calm decision.</p>

<p>“You mean that <em>you</em> will claim the throne?”
the Irishman persisted, still perplexed.</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>The dragoon guard got up and walked the
length of the room, smoking very hard.</p>

<p>“That’s a dangerous business,” he said, as he
came back and stood with the tips of his fingers
resting on the table, “a very dangerous business.”</p>

<p>“There’s no other way in God’s world to find
out who are in the plot,” Grey returned, grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
“I don’t quite see—” O’Hara began, but the
American interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t mastered all the details myself,” he
said, “but that’s the kernel of the nut we’re cracking.
Perhaps von Einhard can aid us. He must
know the conspirators, and he can give us the
names of the men into whose hands we are supposed
to play. I have a suspicion that the Budavian
Minister here in Paris is one of the lot. But
it won’t do to take that for granted. Otherwise
I’d see him before leaving.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking over the idea of consulting
the Baron,” O’Hara ventured, after a
pause. “Suppose he won’t believe you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he will,” the other insisted; “I’ll
make it quite clear to him that I am an American
and that I’m a victim and not an aspirant for
kingly honours, except in so far as goes to set
matters right and bring the guilty to justice.”</p>

<p>“It’s a risk that you take there, lad,” the Irishman
argued; “the more I think of it the bigger it
looks. He’s just as likely to fancy it’s only a
game of yours to throw him off the scent and
secure your own ends. I don’t believe Lindenwald<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
exaggerated his shrewdness. I’ve heard of
him myself.”</p>

<p>Grey rose, leaned over the table and took a
cigarette from a tray.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, as he struck a match, “we’re
liable to find him about this time.”</p>

<p>During the past twenty-four hours he had experienced
a gradual reawakening of faculties that
had previously lain dull or dormant. His five
months of lost memory had had an after-effect in
what he could only describe as a mental thickness.
His thoughts had run slowly and sluggishly; he
had lacked keenness of perception and the ability
to draw deductions; he had been all the while conscious
of a timidity, an indecision, a hesitation, a
tendency to rely upon others, against which he
strove with but little effect. His actions were dictated
by outside suggestion rather than by his own
judgment. And with this, too, was a contrasting
dignity of demeanour unnatural to him, and all
the more annoying in that it was, he knew, superficial
and at discord with his temperament.</p>

<p>The clearing of his brain, the reassertion of his
naturally alert mentality, the recovery of his self-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>reliance,
were now becoming evident; but that
unwonted, and to him unwelcome, exaggeration
of dignity in his carriage and demeanour gave no
sign of deserting him.</p>

<p>O’Hara observed the change and delighted in
it. The soldier in him could find only admiration
for the manner in which Grey had risen mentally
in one day from a subaltern to a commanding officer;
and the dignified, distinguished air which had
seemed, he once thought, a little incongruous appeared
now as most fitting and admirable.</p>

<p>Together they went in search of the Budavian
Baron. Into one café after another they wandered,
but always without success. They encountered
acquaintances by the dozen—men and
women whom Grey and O’Hara had met since
their arrival in Paris, and whom Grey had no recollection
of ever having seen before—but the little,
wiry, sallow-faced Italian-looking nobleman was
nowhere in evidence.</p>

<p>It is never safe, however, to assume that a visitor
to the French capital is abed and asleep simply
because he cannot be found in any of the boulevard
cafés around the hour of midnight.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="X"></a>X</h2>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> the door of the Hôtel Grammont,
Grey and O’Hara stood for some
little time in conversation. As they
were about to part, O’Hara asked:
“You haven’t a revolver, have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” Grey answered, carelessly. “Shall I
need one, do you think?”</p>

<p>“After your experience of last night it seems to
me it would be just as well to sleep with one under
your pillow.”</p>

<p>Grey laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy I shall be disturbed again,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I’ll run over to my place and get you one,”
O’Hara insisted. “I shall be back in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>As he went off at a brisk walk Grey turned into
the wide passage that gave entrance to the court.
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> was not visible, but at the foot of the
narrow stairway to the right a man who in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
dim light had the appearance of one of the hotel
valets, addressed him.</p>

<p>“Captain Lindenwald has returned, Monsieur
Arndt,” he said, quietly, respectfully; “he met
with an accident and has come back. He begs
that Monsieur Arndt will see him before retiring.”</p>

<p>For a moment Grey stood silent in surprise.</p>

<p>“An accident?” he queried, recovering himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. His train ran into an open
switch at Villieurs. His leg is broken in two
places, and he is injured internally. I will show
monsieur to his room.”</p>

<p>As he led the way to the floor above and along
a passage towards the back of the house where
Herr Schlippenbach’s room had been, Grey marvelled
over this new twist in the thread of fate.
That the Captain had returned to this hotel and
had sent for him argued, he thought, that there
must have been some mistake or misunderstanding
as to his departure. If he had meant to desert
his charge he would not under any circumstances
have acted in this fashion. Perhaps—indeed it
was quite possible—he had left a letter which
some stupid French servant had failed to deliver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
or it might simply have been his intention to
spend Sunday out of Paris, giving Lutz and Johann
permission to take a brief holiday as well.
O’Hara had said something about their luggage
being gone, but that might have been an error, too.</p>

<p>At a turn in the passage Grey’s guide halted before
a door and rapped, playing, as it were, a sort
of brief tattoo on the panel with his knuckles; and
at the same time a waiter passed on his way to the
rear stairway.</p>

<p>An instant later the door was opened by someone
who shielded himself behind it. The man
who had led the way and done the rapping stepped
back, and the American, his eyes a little dazzled by
the light, put a foot across the threshold. Just what
followed Grey never exactly knew. A myriad brilliant,
sparkling, rapidly darting specks of fire
filled his vision. In his ears was a thunderous
rushing sound like a storm sweeping through a
forest—a swollen river churning through rocky
narrows. His body seemed dropping through
interminable space, gaining momentum with every
foot of its fall, but shooting straight, straight
downward without a swerve; the lights flashing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
by him, the winds roaring past him as he sped.
An agony of apprehension seized him. He was
going to be crushed to atoms; mangled, broken,
distorted. He tried to raise his arms, to clutch at
the impalpable, but they were held down as if by
leaden weights. To bend a knee, to lift a foot, to
cry out, were alike impossible of achievement.
And then, with a crash that split his ears, that tore
every joint asunder, that racked every nerve,
muscle, sinew and tendon, the end came. The
myriad sparks, like the countless flashing facets of
countless diamonds, were drowned in blackest
night and the terrifying rush of furious winds
and frantic waves was hushed in a silence profound
and awful—the blackness and the silence of
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Very gradually, but in much shorter time than
he fancied, or than his assailants expected, he recovered
command of his faculties and became
aware that he was lying upon a couch, an improvised
gag in his mouth, his arms pinioned in a
most uncomfortable way at his sides, and his feet
bound together with cords that cut cruelly into the
flesh of his ankles. He realised then that he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
been led into a trap and had been sandbagged or
otherwise assaulted as he entered it. His mind
was still busy with Lindenwald and his motives,
he fancied at first that he was responsible for this
outrage, and warily, between his lashes, with his
eyes scarcely opened, he glanced about the room
in search of this gallant member of the Budavian
royal household.</p>

<p>There were, however, but two persons present,
and Lindenwald was not one of them. One was
the little man whom he had mistaken for a hotel
valet and who had lured him to his downfall; and
the other was a tall, burly, bearded fellow, with a
low forehead and sinister, bloodshot eyes. The
two were standing near an open window and the
larger man had in his hands a thick hempen rope,
one end of which Grey observed was knotted about
the heavy post of an old-fashioned mahogany bedstead
which stood against the opposite wall. On
more careful inspection he saw that the man was
deliberately making a slip knot of the pattern
known as a hangman’s noose. The only light in
the room was that given by a single candle, but it
sufficed for Grey to gather these details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
The smaller man leaned out of the window for
a moment, and on drawing in his head he turned
to the other with the remark:</p>

<p>“The carriage is there. Make haste with your
knot. I’m not in love with this business.”</p>

<p>He spoke in German and his partner replied in
the same tongue.</p>

<p>“Have patience,” he said, calmly; “it’s a heavy
body we’ve got to lower and the knot must be
strong. There’s plenty of time. He won’t come
to himself for hours, and there’s no fear of anyone
interrupting us now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” was the reply, in
a tone of nervous apprehension; “we have been
here too long as it is. If we should fail at the
last minute, the Baron would——”</p>

<p>“S—sh!” warned the other, “no names is
safer. Just another wrapping now and she’ll
hold all right. Some wrap it seven times and
some only five, but I’m giving it nine, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished the sentence when a
blow, aggressive and imperious, sounded on the
door. The younger man started nervously, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the other just phlegmatically lowered his work
and raised his head.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“God knows!” the other replied, agitatedly.
“What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Done? Nothing. Keep still, that’s all. Blow
out that candle,” he commanded. Though he
spoke very low his voice penetrated and Grey
caught every word.</p>

<p>Again a heavy blow struck the door, repeated
blows, accompanied by a demand:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ouvrez la porte!</i>”</p>

<p>The voice was O’Hara’s. Grey recognised it
with a thrill. He had returned with the revolver,
and not finding him in his room had set out in
search of him. But how, he wondered, could he
have traced him here? And then he thought of
the waiter he had seen in the passage, who had
evidently recognised him. Yes, the waiter must
have told.</p>

<p>Now Grey heard other voices outside. There
was the shuffling, too, of many feet. Still, the men
within made no sound. The candle had been extinguished
and the darkness was intense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The knocking became clamorous. There was a
general ominous murmur like low growling thunder
from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang! resounded the blows.</p>

<p>“Open the door! Open at once or I’ll break it
down,” O’Hara roared.</p>

<p>Grey’s enforced silence and inertia were maddening.
He bit at his gag, contorted his mouth,
tugged at his arms, but could accomplish nothing,
beyond a wriggling change of position.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have gone,” he heard someone
say, whose voice was sonorous, “perhaps they
have gone. Escaped by the window. There is
no light there; and no sound.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” It was O’Hara speaking. “Listen!”</p>

<p>With an effort Grey squirmed to the edge of
the couch and dropped his bound body to the floor
with a thud that echoed through the silent room.</p>

<p>“Damn him!” he heard the bigger of his two
companions hiss through his teeth.</p>

<p>From outside there came a yell of triumph; and
then a heavy, crashing, catapultian mass fell upon
the fragile portal. There was a crackling, splintering
sound of wood rent apart, and through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
aperture thus made, in the dim light of the single
gas-jet in the passage, O’Hara came plunging
with half a dozen of the hotel employés at his
heels.</p>

<p>At the same instant a head disappeared below
the sill of the window, and the rope from the bedpost
was stretched taut and creaking with the
weight of two descending bodies.</p>

<p>The Irishman, crossing the room in a flash,
missed the form of his prostrate friend by a hair’s-breadth
and dived headlong for the open casement.
But quick as he was the fleeing scapegraces, realising
their danger, were even more speedy. As
his head shot out into the night the strain on the
rope relaxed and there came up from the darkness
below a patter of feet on the stone flagging
of the alley. His pistol was in his hand and he
fired once—twice—three times—blindly into the
blackness beneath, guided only by the echo of
those retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of the Frenchmen—Baptiste,
the waiter, by the way, who had told O’Hara that
he saw Monsieur Arndt enter this room—was removing
the gag from Grey’s mouth, while others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
were cutting the cords that bound his limbs. For
a moment the American’s view of the Irishman’s
broad back was cut off by those surrounding him,
but the next minute he was on his feet and—but
in that instant O’Hara had disappeared. Clutching
the dangling rope, he had swung himself out
of the window and had slid down nimbly in
pursuit.</p>

<p>Grey’s impulse was to follow, but at the first
step he reeled dizzily and would have fallen had
not Baptiste thrown an arm about him and aided
him to a chair. His head was aching splittingly
and his legs and arms were numb. For a little
while he was lost to everything save the racking
torture of physical pain. Then the voluble, excited
clatter of the men about him recalled him to a
sense of what had happened.</p>

<p>“What are you standing here for?” he cried,
vexedly. “Get down to the street, every one of
you. Monsieur O’Hara may need you. Off, I
say. Be quick!”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur,” urged Baptiste, hanging back
as the other five made a hasty exit, “is it not that
monsieur would like a surgeon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
“Surgeon be damned!” yelled Grey, excitedly.
“Out with you!”</p>

<p>But in five minutes they were back again in
augmented numbers, with O’Hara accompanied
by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sergent de ville</i> at their head.</p>

<p>“They got clean away, the beggars,” the Irishman
announced; and then seeing Grey very white,
he exclaimed: “Are you hurt, lad? What in
God’s name did they do to you, the scalawags?”</p>

<p>“I’m only a little knocked up,” the American
answered, with a forced smile; “it was a pretty
hard rap on the head they gave me, though.”</p>

<p>The police officer had taken out a notebook, and
now he began to ask questions. There was very
little, however, that anyone could tell him. Grey
described his assailants as accurately as he knew
how, and gave him the benefit of his suspicions.</p>

<p>“By whom was the room engaged?” asked the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sergent</i>, addressing Baptiste; but Baptiste did not
know. Then a messenger was sent to arouse the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>, who had been abed for an hour or more,
and when at length he came in, still rubbing his
eyes, the information that he gave conveyed
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
The room, he said, was taken that evening by a
man of ordinary appearance who gave the name of
Schmidt. His brother and a friend would occupy
it, he told the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>, and he paid one day’s rent
in advance.</p>

<p>“Was the man tall or short?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> shrugged his stalwart shoulders.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Was he dark or fair?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, monsieur,” he repeated; “I
did not notice.”</p>

<p>“Of what age?”</p>

<p>“It is impossible that I should conjecture, monsieur,”
with another shrug.</p>

<p>Grey laughed, sneeringly. “He evidently paid
more than room rent,” he said to O’Hara. “The
Baron von Einhard is very clever.”</p>

<p>And when, a little while after, he thought of
looking through his pockets he had reason to reiterate
and emphasise this opinion. Not a penny
of his money had been touched; his watch and
chain were still in his possession, as were indeed
all of his belongings save one. The ring of the
Prince of Kronfeld alone was missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Resentment</span>—fierce, vengeful,
absorbing—took possession of Carey
Grey. That he should have been disgraced,
dishonoured, robbed for a
time of his reason and his memory, his
friends made to suffer, his life put in jeopardy,
and all without the slightest provocation, was an
outrage so heinous that he considered no punishment
too great for its perpetrators. The fact that
the one who was apparently mainly responsible
for the inspiration and the execution had been
summoned to a spiritual tribunal to answer for his
misdeeds tempered not a whit the victim’s bitter
animosity. Indeed, he felt that death had cheated
him of what he craved as a meagre compensation
for his wrongs—the opportunity to visit personally
upon the arch-offender his own retribution.
But if Herr Schlippenbach had been snatched
from his hands by a too kindly Providence there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
were others remaining who should feel the weight
of his relentless vengeance.</p>

<p>In this mood, wakeful and dreamful by turns,
a cold compress on his bruised head, Grey worried
through the early hours of the morning. With
the first sign of the blue dawn, however, he became
more composed. His meditations took on a more
gentle guise; his brow, which had been wrinkled
with frowns, smoothed; into his eyes came a tenderness
that routed spleen, and his mouth softened
its tensity of line. The day held for him a joy the
anticipation of which was a benison.</p>

<p>After all, heaven was not wholly unkind. He
had been made to suffer cruelly and undeservedly,
but there was at least one compensation—the
woman he loved was here, near him, in the same
city; in a few hours he would meet her, talk with
her, feel the warmth of her hand in his, experience
the benignant sympathy of her eyes and the
caressing graciousness of her voice. With the
dawn had come confidence, and he smiled as he
recalled his doubts of the previous afternoon. Her
love was steadfast, enduring, immutable. Of this
he felt assured. And her faith and loyalty were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
like her love. He lay for hours in blissful contemplation
of the character, disposition, mind, manner
and person of the woman he adored.</p>

<p>He recalled their first meeting at a barn dance
at Newport, when she was in her débutante year;
and then, an event of the following day came back
to him vividly as in a picture. The scene was the
polo field at Point Judith. He had just made a
goal by dint of hard riding and unerring strokes,
and a hurricane of applause had followed, led, it
seemed to him, by a tall young woman in white,
with great, shining brown eyes and flushed cheeks,
who was standing up in her place atop a coach,
clapping her hands in frantic delight. And this
picture was followed by others—a panorama in
which the same girl figured again and
again—always beautiful, always smart, always
gracious.</p>

<p>He attired himself, this fine Sunday morning,
with more than usual care, despite the absence of
his valet, and set forth early for the rendezvous
he had chosen. Already the boulevards were alive.
Many of the chairs in front of the cafés were occupied
by sippers of absinthe and drinkers of black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
bitters. From the gratings in the sidewalks arose
the appetising aroma of the Parisian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner à la
fourchette</i>. He crossed the Avenue de l’Opéra
and, turning into the rue de la Paix, was presently
passing the entrance of the hotel that sheltered
her who filled his thoughts—her whom he
had come out to meet. A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiacre</i> was at the curb,
and, fancying that it might be awaiting her, he
hastened his steps so that he should not encounter
her in so public a place. From the summit of the
Vendôme Column the imperial-robed Napoleon
cast an abbreviated shadow across his path as he
cut across the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">place</i> into the rue de Castiglione.
A man he did not remember bowed graciously as
he passed him at the corner of the rue de Rivoli,
and a little further on a somewhat showily
gowned woman in an enormous picture hat, probably
on her way to the Madeleine, leaned from her
carriage to smile upon him. And she, likewise,
was without his recollection.</p>

<p>At the corner of the rue Cambon he made a
diagonal cut to the garden side of the street, and
a minute later reached the broad and imposing
Place de la Concorde in all its bravery of bronzed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
iron and granite fountains, sculptured stone figures,
rostral columns and majestic Obelisk.</p>

<p>As he turned into the gardens of the Tuileries,
Grey glanced at his watch to discover that the time
still lacked five minutes of eleven. He looked
back in expectation of seeing a cab approaching,
but, though there were many crossing the place at
various angles, there was none headed in his direction.
He strolled off between the flower-beds
into the little grove at his right. Just ahead of
him he descried a figure in pink, and his heart
bounded; but he overtook it only to meet disappointment.
He lighted a cigarette, sat down on a
bench, and dug in the gravel with his walking-stick;
his eyes, though, ever on the alert, looking
now one way, now another. He took out his
watch again. The minute hand was still a single
space short of twelve. He got up and retraced
his steps towards the entrance with the object of
meeting her as she came in. Again he gazed
across the wide, sun-washed area of the place, but
without reward, and then a dour melancholy
threatened him. He was assailed by forebodings.
She would not come. He had offended her beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
reparation. The day suddenly grew dull. A cloud
hid the sun. The gaiety of those who passed him
became offensive. The sight of a youth with his
sweetheart hanging on his arm filled him with
rancour. He walked back and forth irritably.
He was depressed, heavy-hearted, apprehensive.</p>

<p>Another five minutes dragged by, with a corresponding
increase in the young man’s dejection.
His imagination was now active. It was quite
possible she had left Paris. His messenger, perhaps,
had failed to deliver his note. He wondered
if by any chance she might be ill.</p>

<p>He was standing, pensive, by the fountain, undecided
whether to wait longer or to go on to the
Ritz in search of her, when the rustle of skirts
behind him caused him to turn.</p>

<p>“Ah—h!” exclaimed a laughing voice, “it is
then you after all. I was not sure. I looked and
I looked, but you are so changed, Mr. Grey!”</p>

<p>It was Marcelle, Miss Van Tuyl’s maid, and at
the sound of her peculiar accent Grey recognised
her instantly. He realised, too, that it was she
whom he had seen on the moment of his coming—the
figure in the pink frock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
“Miss Van Tuyl sent this note, Mr. Grey,” she
went on, handing him an envelope which he
noticed was unaddressed.</p>

<p>His spirits rose a trifle. She had not left Paris,
then, and she had received his message.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Tuyl is not ill, I hope?” he questioned,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Grey,” and Marcelle shrugged
her plump shoulders and raised her black eyebrows,
“but—” and she hesitated just the shade
of a second “she is—oh, I fear she is most unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Marcelle,” he said,
ignoring her comment, though the words were as
a sword-thrust, and handing her a louis. “Is
there an answer?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, monsieur; but I think not.”</p>

<p>Grey tore open the envelope and glanced over
the inclosure.</p>

<p>“No,” he announced, his face very set and suddenly
pale. “Give my compliments to Miss Van
Tuyl,” he added, “that is all.”</p>

<p>When the girl had gone he turned again into
the little grove and once more found the seat under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the trees where a few minutes before he had impatiently
dug the gravel with his walking-stick.
He sat now with his forearms resting on his
thighs, the note crushed in his hand, his eyes bent,
thoughtful but unseeing, on the grass across the
walk.</p>

<p>She had refused to come to him. It was probably
better, she had written, that they should not
meet again. She could imagine nothing in the
way of explanation that would form an adequate
excuse for his action of the afternoon before. And
that was all. Only five lines in a large hand.</p>

<p>The self-chastisement of the man was pitiless;
his contrition pathetic. He was willing now to
make any sacrifice, to suffer any abasement, to risk
any punishment, to sustain any loss if by so doing
he could gain forgiveness, achieve reinstatement
in favour—aye, even attain the privilege of pleading
his cause. He had been so sure of her; it had
not seemed possible that she could ever be other
than love and devotion and loyalty personified.
Her smile was the one sun he thought would never
set and never be clouded. And now she had taken
this light from his life forever. With that gone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
he asked himself, what else in all the world mattered?
What were honour, position, credit, fortune,
if she were not to share them?</p>

<p>He smoothed out the crumpled sheet and read
it again, slowly, carefully, weighing each word,
measuring each phrase, considering each sentence.
And then the utter hopelessness of his expression
changed. “It is probably better,” he repeated,
quoting from the note, and the “probably”
seemed larger and more prominent than any other
eight letters on the page. There was nothing
absolutely final about that. It was an assertion,
to be sure, but there was a lot of qualification in
that “probably.” And further on, she had not
said: “There is nothing in the way of explanation
you can offer,” but “<em>I can imagine</em> nothing.”
He thanked God for that “I can imagine.” Oh,
yes, indeed, there was a very large loophole there;
and so he took heart of grace, and even smiled,
and got up swinging his stick jauntily. All he
wanted was a fighting chance. He had won her a
year ago from a score of rivals, and he would win
her now from herself. And not from herself,
either, for with the return of hope he felt that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
would have no more stanch ally than she. It was
with her sense of what was fit and becoming that
he must battle—her pride and her self-esteem
which he had outraged. He would go to her,
bravely, as he should have done before, instead of
asking her to meet him in this clandestine fashion.
He had been a fool, but he would make amends
and she would forgive him. Yes, he was quite
sanguine now that he could win her pardon.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps briskly to the Place Vendôme
and turned in at the Ritz with head erect
and chin thrust forward. He had no cards, of
course, but he scribbled “<em>Carey Grey</em>” upon a slip
of paper and asked that it be sent to Miss Van
Tuyl at once. And then he waited, nervously,
smoking one cigarette after another, walking back
and forth, sitting down, only to get up again,
agitatedly, and to resume his pacing to and fro.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Tuyl is not at home, monsieur.”</p>

<p>It was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i> who delivered the message.
Grey stood for a full half-minute, staring stupidly.
He had not counted upon this. He had been all
confidence. That she was in the hotel he felt very
certain; but she would not see him. He might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
have foreseen that consistency demanded this attitude
of her. To send him a note one moment
refusing to permit him to explain and at the next
to grant him an audience was not to be expected
of a young woman of Hope Van Tuyl’s sterling
character. There was, therefore, but one course
open to him. What he had to say he must put
in writing.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave a note,” he said to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portier</i>; and
he went into the writing-room and sat down at a
table. But when he came to write he was embarrassed
by the flood of matter that craved expression.
There was so much to tell, so much to
make clear, so much to plead that he was staggered
by the contemplation. Again and again he began,
and again and again he tore the sheet of paper into
tiny bits. He dipped his pen into the ink and held
it poised while he made effort to frame an opening
sentence; and the ink dried on the nib as one
thought after another was evolved only to be
rejected.</p>

<p>For the fifth time he wrote: “My Very Dearest,”
and then, nettled over his laggard powers, he
dove straight and determinedly into the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the subject that engrossed him, writing rapidly
and without pause until he had finished:</p>

<p>“I cannot find it in my heart to question the
justice of your decision,” he began. “Viewed in
the light of your meagre knowledge, or rather
ignorance, of facts, I must look indeed very black.
But I am guiltless; that I swear. Under the circumstances
you must know how anxious I am to
prove this, and how, in justice to you and myself,
I must let no opportunity pass to discover and
convict the real culprits. To have recognised you
at Versailles yesterday before the man you were
with would have been to ruin every chance of
accomplishing what I have set out to do. Imagine,
my dear, the alternative from which I had to
choose. Had it been simply a question of my personal
liberty, you cannot doubt which course I
should have taken. I was burning to speak to you—to
look into the eyes I love, to hear the voice I
adore—and yet for both our sakes I had to deny
myself. The child who was with me is sweet and
charming, and in no way implicated in the plot
against me. When you know her, as I hope you
will one day, you will be very fond of her. But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
can understand how the situation must have appeared
to you. I would give all I have and all I
hope for if I could but be with you and tell you
everything. All I ask now is that you trust me.
I am leaving Paris this afternoon for Kürschdorf
by the Orient Express. I cannot say when I shall
return. But when I do it will be to search for you,
and with honour vindicated and no further need of
secrecy. My heart is with you always, my darling.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">’Au revoir.</i>”</p>

<p>The letter dulled, in a measure, the keenness of
Grey’s disappointment and reinspired him to the
accomplishment of the task that lay before him.
After luncheon he had up his trunks from the
hotel storeroom and with Baptiste’s assistance accomplished
his packing. Already O’Hara had engaged
places for three on the train, for Miss von
Altdorf’s destination was the same as theirs. She
had a married sister living in Kürschdorf, and she
was most anxious to join her at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>By half-past five everything was in readiness
for their departure; Baptiste had retired with a
liberal tip, and Grey and O’Hara were making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
themselves ready for the journey. Just at this
juncture there was a knock at the door, and in
answer to Grey’s command to enter, it swung open
to reveal, bowing on the threshold, the sturdy little
figure, pale face, and close-cropped yellow head of
Johann.</p>

<p>The two occupants of the room stood astonished,
their eyes wide with surprise.</p>

<p>“Johann!” they exclaimed together.</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt,” said the lad, bowing again;
“it is as you see—I have come back.”</p>

<p>“Back from where, Johann?” Grey asked.</p>

<p>“I started for Kürschdorf with the Herr Captain
Lindenwald; but I am come back from Strasburg.”</p>

<p>“And why?” queried the American, very much
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Because, Herr Arndt, I knew it was not right
for me to be going with the Herr Captain. I was
in your service, and perhaps if you were seized
with madness you have all the more need of me.”</p>

<p>“Madness!” repeated Grey, frowning. “What
is this? Who said I was mad?”</p>

<p>“The Herr Captain and Lutz,” confessed Johann,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
stolidly, with scarce a change of expression.</p>

<p>O’Hara laughed. “Oh, ho!” he shouted,
dropping into a chair, “now we have it. You are
mad, and so you cannot go to Budavia to claim
your own.”</p>

<p>Johann nodded; and Grey, leaning against the
edge of the table, was lost for a moment in
thought.</p>

<p>“But the Fraülein?” O’Hara questioned.
“What did they say of her? Was she to be left
with the madman?”</p>

<p>“No, Herr O’Hara; only for a little. The Herr
Captain Lindenwald had arranged, Lutz told me,
to have Herr Arndt taken to an asylum by the
doctors and then the Fraülein was to be brought
to Kürschdorf.”</p>

<p>Grey smiled, grimly. “The doctors were the
gentlemen you chased out of the window last
night, Jack,” he said. And then he asked of
Johann: “Did they say anything of Baron von
Einhard?”</p>

<p>“No, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“I have not heard of his name, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>Then Johann was told of the plan of departure
and was sent off to telephone for another place on
the Orient Express for himself. When he returned
the American said to him:</p>

<p>“It was very good of you, Johann, to come
back.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Herr Arndt,” he returned, in a tone of
appreciation, “I could not do less. Can I ever,
do you think, forget that it was you who saved
my life?”</p>

<p>Grey’s surprise must have shown in his eyes,
but he asked no questions. Later, however, just
as they were about to start for the Gare de Strasbourg,
he found himself alone with O’Hara for a
moment and put the query to him:</p>

<p>“What is this about my having saved Johann’s
life?”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember it? Oh, of course not,”
the Irishman answered. “Well, you had your
pluck with you, lad, if you didn’t have your memory.
We were in that fire at the Folsonham, in
Piccadilly. It happened in the early morning when
the whole house was asleep, and that the death list<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
was not larger was little short of a miracle. The
front stairs were burning as Schlippenbach, the
Fraülein and you and I reached them. When I
got to the bottom I missed you, and looking back
saw you through the smoke still standing at the
top. ‘For God’s sake, make haste, man!’ I called,
‘the stairs may fall at any minute.’ But you had
seen a figure staggering down, half suffocated,
from the floor above. Well, instead of saving
yourself you went back to help that figure, which
proved to be Johann. And even at that moment
the staircase fell with a crash. But you caught
the stumbling, dazed Budavian from out a hurricane
of sparks, rushed him through a room filled
with blinding smoke and climbed with him hanging
limp over your shoulder out of a window
onto an already burning ten-inch cornice. And
there you held him, against the wall, God only
knows how, until a ladder was run up and the
pair of you brought safely to the street just as
the cornice crumbled and went down. And, good
Lord, but didn’t the crowd cheer! Only fancy
your not remembering anything of it!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I managed it,” said Grey, simply.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
But the story depressed him. What else had he
done in those five months of somnambulism? The
thought of that period and its possibilities had
grown distressful to him. He had committed a
great crime and he had performed a brave deed.
They were the opposite poles of that world of
sleep. But what other acts lay between? What
other incidents of right and wrong filled the intermediate
zones? He shrank from asking general
questions on the subject, and speculation was as
distasteful as it was futile. When, as in this instance,
accident had revealed something, the result
was a sort of emotional nausea.</p>

<h2><a id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">On</span> the platform of the Gare de l’Est,
with ten minutes to spare before the
departure of the Orient Express, Grey
and O’Hara, with the fair Minna von
Altdorf between them, strolled leisurely up and
down beside the long and lugubrious train
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">wagons-lit</i>. There was the usual bustle
incident to the leaving of the great transcontinental
flyer. Passengers were nervously seeking
their locations; blue-overalled porters wheeling
trucks piled high with trunks and boxes hurried
towards the luggage vans, and others with
smaller impedimenta in hand crowded on the narrow
platforms of the cars and ran into the still
smaller passageways upon which the compartments
opened. English and American tourists
unable to speak the language of the country were
besieging the interpreters; friends and kinsfolk
with lingering handshakes, effusive embraces, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
kisses upon either cheek were bidding departing
travellers farewell, and dapper-uniformed guards
were at intervals repeating the stereotyped command:
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En voiture, messieurs!</i>” There was the
distracting hissing of escaping steam, the shrill
piping of whistles, the rumble and roar of
arriving trains. And over all hung an atmosphere
of intolerably humid heat.</p>

<p>O’Hara and the Fraülein were chatting animatedly,
but Grey was still depressed and silent.
The delay irritated him. He was impatient to be
gone. For the hundredth time he was wondering
whether he had said too much or too little in
his letter to Hope Van Tuyl; wondering how she
regarded it; whether she was still obdurate. He
had not given her an address and there was no
way in which she could communicate with him.
He regretted this now. A word from her would
be a talisman.</p>

<p>His memory of her as he had seen her yesterday
at Versailles was very vivid. It was only a
glimpse, but in that instant he had drunk in greedily
the marvellous perfection of her beauty; and
the picture had dwelt with him since. Sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
and waking he could see the bronze dusk of her
hair, the gentleness of her eyes, the softly flushed
curve of her cheek, the tender sympathy of her
mouth, the supple grace of her figure. The portrait
was not new to him, to be sure—he had many
times revelled in fond contemplation of those rare
features—but absence had its usual effect, and it
had been centuries, it seemed, since his vision had
been so blessed. Against the dull, dun, grimy
background of the railway station this radiant reflection
was projected, clear and sharp. He saw
her mentally just as he had seen her physically on
the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>And as he gazed a miracle was wrought. For
into and out of the image came and grew the reality,
and he suddenly realised that she was standing
before him, that in one hand he was holding
his hat and that his other hand was clasping hers.
All the sights and sounds of the platform died
away, and he saw only her, more beautiful even
than he had dreamed, her eyes alight with love,
her lips smiling forgiveness.</p>

<p>O’Hara and the Fräulein had passed on, and he
and the one woman in the world had drawn aside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
out of the hurry and scurry. A few steps away
stood Marcelle, the maid, her interest decorously
diverted.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are!” Grey was saying,
his heart in his voice; “how very, very good you
are!”</p>

<p>Her hand answered the ardent pressure of his.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t let you go without seeing you,”
she returned. “You cannot imagine what I have
suffered. I tried to be brave—I tried so hard,
dear; but I’m only a weak woman and my soul
longed for you every minute.”</p>

<p>What bliss it was to hear her speak! It set
the man’s pulses surging. His face was flushed
and young and happy again, as it had not been
since his awakening.</p>

<p>“The whole thing has been frightful,” he told
her, clenching his teeth at the recollection. “You
haven’t an idea what a net of circumstance has
been thrown around me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she hastened, “I know—they told me
you had been ill, irresponsible; that you had had
brain fever or something, and—oh, Carey, why
did you do that?” and she pointed to his beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
He smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it,” he answered, with emphasis.
“You surely don’t think I’d be guilty of such a
ridiculous transformation, do you?”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“I’ll explain some day, dear heart,” he interrupted
her, “but there isn’t time now; the
train leaves in about five minutes, and I want
all of that in which to tell you how very beautiful
you are and how very, very much I love
you.”</p>

<p>She wore a perfectly fitting gown of white with
rich lace, and a large hat of pale blue with a
circling ostrich plume of the same delicate tint.
Her tall and shapely figure was quite unavoidably
a little conspicuous, and a target for admiring
glances.</p>

<p>“Leaves in five minutes?” she repeated, dolorously.
“But I can’t let you go in five minutes.
I have so much to say to you. It has been five
months since I spoke to you. You must wait and
take the next train—wait until tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“If only I might!” Grey replied, his eyes in
hers. “If it could only be we should never part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
again, never! Ah, my own, how my arms ache
for you!”</p>

<p>“But you can stay,” she urged. He was still
holding her hand, and now she placed her other
hand over his as she pleaded. “There is no reason
why you shouldn’t. What difference will
twenty-four hours make? Are you going for the
King’s funeral? It is set for Friday, you know.
We are thinking of going ourselves. Wait until
tomorrow, and you and papa and I can go together.”</p>

<p>“But, my darling,” Grey protested, arguing
against his inclination, “don’t you see that that
would be quite impossible? Your father could
not afford to be seen with me. I am a supposed
fugitive from justice. He would be guilty of aiding
and abetting a criminal,” and he smiled grimly
again.</p>

<p>“What would he care?” the young woman demanded,
airily. “He doesn’t believe you guilty.
He knows you are not. He has said as much. I
can’t let you go, dear; I can’t—I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Please, please don’t make it more difficult for
me to part from you than it is already,” he begged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
“You know how much I long to have you with
me, and yet another day’s delay might ruin everything.
I should be in Kürschdorf at this very
minute.”</p>

<p>Her eyes glistened and tears hung on her lashes.</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked, simply.</p>

<p>“All my hopes of undoing the wrong that has
been done me lie in that direction,” he answered,
gravely. “It was a conspiracy, dear, involving
men high in the Budavian government. The work
of unmasking them will grow more difficult with
each hour it is put off.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“You are going into danger,” she murmured.
Her voice trembled. Anxiety was in her tone.
She pressed his hands nervously, convulsively.
“Tell me the truth. You are, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Grey laughed to reassure her.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, my darling,” he answered, with an
assumption of nonchalance; “the whole affair can,
I think, be adjusted most peacefully.”</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent, her eyes reading
his thoughts.</p>

<p>“I’m going with you,” she exclaimed, suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Grey stared at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“I only wish you could,” he said, refusing to
take her seriously, “but I don’t see just how——”</p>

<p>“I’m going,” she interrupted, determinedly.
“I shan’t be in the least in your way, that I
promise. But I’m going. I refuse to be left behind.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En voiture, messieurs et mesdames!</i>”</p>

<p>The guard’s command had grown imperative.
The second bell had rung.</p>

<p>Grey pulled out his watch. It showed thirty
seconds of starting time. O’Hara was standing
at the car’s step looking anxiously towards him.
Johann was at his side, his hat deferentially raised.</p>

<p>“The train is now to start, Herr Arndt,” he
said.</p>

<p>The man turned to the woman he loved.</p>

<p>“I am going with you,” she reiterated before
he could speak; and she beckoned to Marcelle.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En voiture!</i>” shouted the guards.</p>

<p>There was no time for further protest or parley.
The four crossed the platform hurriedly. Hope
entered the car, her maid following; and then
Grey, with O’Hara at his heels and Johann bringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
up the rear, stepped from the platform of
the station to the platform of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">wagon-lit</i>.</p>

<p>The third bell rang; the locomotive whistled its
piping treble, gates clashed, doors slammed, and
the Orient Express drew slowly and solemnly out
of the hot, dingy station into the red glare of the
torrid June sunset.</p>

<p>After the presentation of Miss von Altdorf and
Lieutenant O’Hara had been accomplished Grey
left Hope in their company and went in search of
the conductor. As it happened, there were several
berths to spare in the sleeping-car, and he arranged
for the accommodation of Miss Van Tuyl
and her maid. There would be no stop, however,
he learned, until they reached Château-Thierry,
at 8.15. From there, the conductor told him, a
telegram might be sent.</p>

<p>Before returning to the compartment Grey lit
a cigarette and stood for a few minutes in the refreshing
draft that swept through the narrow
passage. To have Hope with him was a joy undreamt,
and yet he could not repress a little uneasiness
over her action. He feared that in a
calmer mood she might regret her impulsiveness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
as savouring too strongly of a sensational elopement.
He wondered how Nicholas Van Tuyl
would regard it. He was, Grey knew, the most
indulgent of fathers, but his anxiety over her
absence would necessarily be poignant, and there
was no possible means of getting word to him
of her safety until hours after he had missed her.
But in spite of these reflections Carey Grey was
experiencing a gratified pride in the fact that the
girl had acted as she had. She was proving her
love for him and her faith in him by a disregard
of convention that was undeniably very flattering,
particularly grateful after his recent trying experiences,
and his affection for her, if possible,
waxed warmer under the stimulus of appreciation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trio Grey had left to their own
devices, with scarcely a word of explanation, were
getting into a wellnigh inextricable tangle.</p>

<p>“Fancy my deciding to run off this way on the
spur of the moment, without even a handful of
luggage,” Miss Van Tuyl had exclaimed, “but
Mr. Grey and I have so much to talk about I just
couldn’t think of waiting another twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
hours, and he said he couldn’t possibly stop over
another day in Paris.”</p>

<p>Minna had recognised her minutes before on the
platform, as the beautiful lady she had noticed
the previous afternoon at Versailles, and she had
been and was still wondering how it came about
that her Uncle Max had not seen her and spoken
to her there. And now this mention of a Mr.
Grey perplexed her. Was he in another car or
another compartment? And if she had so much
to say to him why had she stood talking to another
man until the train was on the point of leaving?
and why was she sitting here now instead of
being with him?</p>

<p>“American women are such fun,” O’Hara was
saying, his cheery, ruddy face one broad smile.
“I admire them awfully. They’re so superbly
self-reliant.”</p>

<p>“You’re an American, Miss Van Tuyl?” the
Fräulein ventured. “Oh, of course. It was in
America, I suppose, you met Uncle Max?”</p>

<p>Hope stared questioningly.</p>

<p>“Uncle Max?” she questioned. “I don’t understand
you. Who is——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
“Didn’t you know he was my uncle?” the girl
asked, a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Really, I—” she began again. And then
O’Hara came to the rescue:</p>

<p>“Our mutual friend, Miss Van Tuyl. After
all, what’s in a name? Miss von Altdorf calls
him ‘Uncle Max’ and you—what is your favourite
pet name for him? Or is it rude of me to
ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” Hope implored, addressing
the fair-haired girl beside her; “how
stupid of me! Yes, of course; I met him in
America when we were both very young. You
were with him yesterday at Versailles, weren’t
you? I remember you distinctly. Mr. Grey wrote
me something very nice about you.”</p>

<p>“About me? Mr. Grey?” It was the Fräulein’s
turn to be audibly perplexed.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, Mr. Grey wrote me about you.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know any Mr. Grey.”</p>

<p>O’Hara laughed aloud. Should he or should
he not, he asked himself, set them right and thus
end this game of cross-purposes? It was very
amusing, it appealed to his native love of fun and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
he enjoyed it, so he concluded to let the play
go on.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Miss von Altdorf,” Hope insisted,
“do you mean to tell me that you don’t
know your Uncle Max’s name is Grey?”</p>

<p>Minna’s eyes were wide with amazement.
Could it be possible that her uncle was known in
the United States by another name? The supposition
was preposterous.</p>

<p>“My Uncle Max’s name is Arndt,” she said,
very decidedly. “He is my mother’s brother, and
my mother’s name was Arndt before she married.”</p>

<p>Hope leaned back in the hot, stuffy cushions of
the railway carriage, nonplussed. This was altogether
beyond her understanding. And the Fräulein,
a little nettled, but triumphant, sat looking
at her with something of pity in her great long-lashed
blue eyes, while O’Hara on the seat opposite
was bent double in a convulsion of merriment.</p>

<p>“I don’t really see, Mr. O’Hara,” Minna observed,
rebukingly, a moment later, “what there
is to laugh over. Would you mind telling me?”</p>

<p>The Irishman, who had more than a passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
fondness for the girl, pulled a straight face on the
instant.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Miss von Altdorf,” he apologised.
“It’s too bad of me, isn’t it? And I beg Miss
Van Tuyl’s pardon, too. I’d like to explain the
whole blessed thing to you both, but to tell the
truth, I fancy the gentleman of the mixed nomenclature
had better be after doing it himself.”</p>

<p>But when Grey arrived and the situation was
laid before him, the explanation was not at the
moment forthcoming. He evaded it as deftly as
he knew how, which, if the truth be told, was not
by any means to the taste of either of the ladies.
It would have been an easy matter to clear the
mystery for Hope, but he hesitated to confess to
Minna, in the presence of the others, that he had
been sailing under false colours. She was a sensitive
child, and serious, and he had no relish for
inflicting the pain that his unmasking would, he
knew, entail. So he simply said:</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a long story and we’ll have it at another
time. Just now I want to know what Miss
Van Tuyl is going to wire to her doting father.”</p>

<p>O’Hara excused himself and went out, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
von Altdorf extracted a novel from her satchel
and buried herself in its pages.</p>

<p>“Wire him,” Hope directed, “that I’ve gone
on with you unexpectedly to Kürschdorf to secure
rooms for the royal obsequies, and that he is to
follow tomorrow night with the luggage.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t get it until late tonight, you
know; possibly not until tomorrow morning,”
Grey told her.</p>

<p>“No, he won’t get it until after two o’clock tomorrow,
at the earliest,” she replied, smiling.</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” he asked, surprised.</p>

<p>“Because he went to Trouville last night to see
a man,” she laughed. “He does not leave there
until nine-one tomorrow morning, and it takes
these crawling French railway trains five hours
to make the journey.”</p>

<h2><a id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“Kürschdorf,” the</span> guide-books
will tell you, “is the Capital of
the Kingdom of Budavia; 118
miles from Munich and forty-nine
miles from Nuremberg. It stands on both
banks of the Weisswasser, united by the
Charlemagne and Wartberg bridges, 400 yards
long. Surrounded by towering mountains its
King’s Residenz Schloss, erected 1607–1642, rises
like the Acropolis above the dwellings and other
buildings of the city. The steep sides of the Wartberg
(1,834 feet) rise directly from amid the
houses of the town, and it is on one extremity of
the elevation that the imposing royal palace is
located, with its 365 rooms, frescoes and statues,
a ‘Diana’ of Canova, a ‘Perseus’ of Schwanhaler,
a ‘Sleeping Ariadne’ of Thorwaldsen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and casts. The palace gardens are two miles long,
and consist of a series of terraces overlooking the
Wartberg valley on one side and a fertile plain on
the other.”</p>

<p>The guide-books, too, will tell you of the Königsbau,
a quarter-mile long, containing a coffee
house, the Bourse, and the Concert Hall; and of
the Museum, where the chief treasures of Kürschdorf
are on view daily (10 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span> TO 4 <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span>); and
of the Hof Theatre, and of the beer gardens. And
they will give you a long and detailed description
of the cathedral, completed in 1317, with its spire
452 feet high, ascended by 575 steps, its wonderful
astronomical clock, and its great west window.
They will even tell you that the best shops are in
the Schloss Strasse, and that the Grand Hotel
Königin Anna is a first-class and well-situated
hostelry. But in no one of them will you find any
mention of the most ancient dwelling house in
all Kürschdorf, a quaint, dark stone building, on
the Graf Strasse, only a stone’s throw from the
Friedrich Platz and two blocks away from the
Wartburg Brücke.</p>

<p>At the moment Carey Grey was sending his telegram<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
from the railway station at Château-Thierry
to Nicholas Van Tuyl, in Paris, Count
Hermann von Ritter, Chancellor of Budavia, was
standing at a rear window of this venerable
Kürschdorf mansion, gazing out upon a spacious
and orderly rose garden. He was very tall and
very angular. From a fringe of silver-white hair
rose a shining pink crown; from beneath bushy
brows of only slightly darker grey appeared small,
keen black eyes; and a moustache of the same
colour, heavy but close-cropped, accentuated rather
than hid a straight, thin-lipped, nervous mouth.
His head was bent thoughtfully forward and his
hands, long and sinewy, with sharply defined
knuckles, were clasped behind his back.</p>

<p>The drawing-room in which he stood was large
and square, with high walls hung with many
splendid pictures in heavy gilded frames. The
furniture was massive and richly carved. Rococo
cabinets held a wealth of curios—odd vases and
drinking cups of repoussé work in gold and silver;
idols from the Orient, peculiar antique knives—bodkins
and poniards, and carvings of jade and
ivory and ebony. The polished floor was strewn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
with Eastern rugs of silken texture, and at the
doors and windows were hangings of still softer
fabric and less florid colour and ornamentation.</p>

<p>After a little the Count crossed to a table on
which stood lighted candelabra, and taking out his
watch glanced at it with some show of impatience.
Almost at the same moment a bell jangled, and
very soon after a portière was raised by a servant
wearing the Court mourning livery.</p>

<p>“Herr Captain Lindenwald, your Excellency!”
he announced. And the Captain entered, saluting.</p>

<p>He was flushed and somewhat ill at ease, and
the Chancellor’s icy manner as he bade him be
seated was not altogether reassuring.</p>

<p>“I am very much distressed over the news conveyed
by your telegram,” began the older man,
when he had taken a chair at a little distance from
his visitor. “Any delay at this juncture, you must
understand, is only calculated to result in complications.
Was His Royal Highness so violent that
to bring him with you was impracticable?”</p>

<p>Lindenwald hesitated for just the shade of a
second, his fingers playing nervously with the arm
of his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
“I regarded the risk as too great,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“That is no answer,” the Count returned, irritably.
“I asked you if he was violent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Count, he was,” replied the Captain,
with sudden assurance. “He was very violent at
intervals. It would have been impossible to get
him here without his causing a scene at some stage
of the journey and probably revealing his identity.
Besides, it was most dangerous. He was liable to
evade his watchers and throw himself from the
train.”</p>

<p>The annoyance of the Chancellor increased.</p>

<p>“You have never heard, Captain,” he said with
a sneer, “that there are such things as handcuffs
and strait-jackets.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but Count,” pleaded the other, in a tone
of conciliation. “His Royal Highness! Could
I put the Crown Prince to such humiliation? You
know yourself that I would not be justified. It
was better, it seemed to me, to have him safely
confined in a private hospital in Paris for the
present. In a little while, perhaps, his mind will
clear.”</p>

<p>“What is the form of his mania?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
“It is most peculiar,” explained the Herr Captain.
“You understand, of course, that until five
months ago he had no idea whatever that he was
who he is. He was, as you have been told, a
valet, but a very superior man of his class. It is
most certainly true that blood counts. He had all
the inherent dignity of birth. His mind was far
above his assumed station. All this you know.
You may not have heard, though, that he was employed
by an American stock broker named Grey
who one day embezzled four hundred thousand
marks and ran away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in the Count, “I was informed of
that as well.”</p>

<p>“Just so. Well,” continued the Captain, “His
Royal Highness now, strangely enough, imagines
that he is Grey.”</p>

<p>“Imagines that he is an embezzler?” queried
Ritter.</p>

<p>“Precisely. He even cabled to New York giving
his Paris address, and the United States Embassy
there was for arresting him and having him
extradited.”</p>

<p>“And when did this mania develop?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
“After the death of the Herr Doctor Schlippenbach.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor sat thoughtfully rubbing together
his long, virile hands.</p>

<p>“But I thought that this man Grey, this embezzler,
committed suicide—was drowned or
something.”</p>

<p>“He was,” Lindenwald assented, “at least he
is supposed to be dead.”</p>

<p>“It will be possible, I presume,” the Count pursued,
after another moment of meditation, “to
have the present temporary regency continued by
simply proving that Prince Maximilian, the heir
apparent, is alive and mentally incapacitated,
though to have had him here in the flesh would
have been far better. And now as to these proofs—I
am in possession of copies of the papers, but
where are the originals?”</p>

<p>The Captain shifted uneasily in his chair, and
his eyes refused to meet those of his interlocutor.</p>

<p>“That is a question, Count,” he replied.</p>

<p>“A question!” cried the other, surprised and
annoyed. “Why a question? Surely you are in
possession of them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
“Alas, I am not!”</p>

<p>His Excellency, his face crimson, sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>“My God, Captain!” he exclaimed in a rage,
“you exasperate me beyond all bearing.”</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry, Count von Ritter,” returned
Lindenwald, “but if you will hear me for
one moment you will know that I am not to
blame.”</p>

<p>“Excuses will not avail,” he retorted, glowering.
“You are a bungler, sir, a bungler. You
have been either criminally careless in this matter
or intentionally—yes, Captain, intentionally criminal.”</p>

<p>“Your Excellency!” The Captain arose with
a fine assumption of anger. “I permit no man,
your Excellency——”</p>

<p>The Chancellor’s lips were close pressed. His
beady eyes were two points of fire.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” he said, “this is neither the time
nor place for that sort of thing. I am pained, distressed,
mortified. From first to last your mission
has been a series of blunders. Delay has followed
delay; excuse has followed excuse; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
now, at the crucial moment, comes the climax of
your incapacity. A child could have done better.
Knowing the importance of getting the Prince of
Kronfeld here while His Majesty still lived you,
on one pretext and another, dawdled away week
after week in London and Paris; you permitted
knowledge of the existence of the Prince to leak
out; you could not even hide your stopping
place from Hugo’s emissaries—ah, you see
I am well posted—and finally you come here not
only without the heir but without the documents
that are absolutely essential to the continuance of
the direct succession.”</p>

<p>Lindenwald listened, cowed and speechless.
After a little, however, he spoke falteringly, while
the Count, his hands behind him, strode excitedly
up and down the large, square drawing-room.</p>

<p>“If you will but hear me,” he protested, sullenly,
“I think—I am indeed almost certain, your
Excellency, that I can show you I am at least not
altogether to blame. The Herr Doctor was ill when
he landed in England. He was, moreover, most
eccentric and most self-willed. And His Royal
Highness was of the Herr Doctor’s mind, always.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
For me to make a more expeditious journey was,
under the circumstances, impossible. It appeared
to me that it was the Herr Doctor’s object to delay
our arrival until after the death of His Majesty.
Then, as you know, Herr Doctor Schlippenbach
died, somewhat suddenly, and the madness of the
Prince ensued.”</p>

<p>“But the papers, the papers?” cried von Ritter,
irritably, halting in his walk. “What of them?”</p>

<p>“The Herr Doctor never so much as showed
them to me, Count. They were, I understand, in
a strong-box, of which he and Prince Maximilian
had duplicate keys. But the strong-box when we
reached Paris was not brought to our hotel.
Schlippenbach seemed to think it would be safer
at the railway station. I argued with him, but to
no avail. There was a fire, you remember, at our
hotel in London, and that it and its contents were
not destroyed was simply miraculous. It was that
which frightened the Herr Doctor, and he refused
to risk it in another hotel. Well, your Excellency,
after his death we could find no trace of the box.
The receipt for it had disappeared. I did my utmost
to locate and secure it, but as yet I have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
unsuccessful. I have tracers out, however, and it
may be discovered any day.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” almost shrieked the Chancellor, irascibly,
“and a throne hangs on the slender thread
of that ‘may be.’ Unless the box is found, Captain,
it will be well for you to—but it is needless
for me to suggest. You yourself know that your
life, henceforth, would be not only useless, but a
burden.”</p>

<p>Lindenwald’s chin dropped and his eyes sought
the floor.</p>

<p>“The box shall be found,” he said; but the assurance
in his tone was meagre.</p>

<p>“And His Royal Highness,” continued von Ritter,
“is in a sanitarium in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Count; the sanitarium of——”</p>

<p>But a rap on the door cut short his answer, and
the name either was not pronounced or was
drowned in the Chancellor’s stentorian:</p>

<p>“<em>Herein!</em>”</p>

<p>A footman handed His Excellency a telegram,
and with a “Pardon me, Captain!” he opened it.</p>

<p>Years of diplomatic training had given the
Count von Ritter a command of his facial muscles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that was perfect. Not by so much even as the
quiver of an eyelash did he signify the character
of the tidings thus conveyed to him. Having read
the message at a glance he refolded the paper with
some deliberation, and then turning to Lindenwald
again, asked:</p>

<p>“In whose sanitarium did you say?”</p>

<p>“Dr. De Cerveau’s.”</p>

<p>“You saw him there yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Count.”</p>

<p>“And there is no possible chance of his escaping?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, Count.”</p>

<p>His Excellency took another turn to the window
overlooking the rose garden, his head bowed meditatively.
Lindenwald was still standing, his arm
resting on the high back of the chair from which
he had risen.</p>

<p>“You are quite sure,” His Excellency pursued,
when he was again opposite the Captain, “that we
need have no apprehension on that score?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, Count von Ritter.”</p>

<p>Very slowly, and with a care and precision that
emphasised the action, the Chancellor again unfolded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the telegram he held and extended it towards
Lindenwald.</p>

<p>“Then you will, perhaps, explain to me what
that means?” he said, with a calmness that was
portentous.</p>

<p>The face of the Herr Captain went ashen white.
He caught his breath sharply, and his left hand
gripped the chair back where a second before his
arm had rested.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Am leaving this evening, Orient Express</i>,” he
read. “<i>Have me met on arrival.</i> <span class="smcap">Arndt.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>He made as if to speak, but his lips emitted no
sound.</p>

<p>“Well? Well?” queried the Count, impatiently.
“What is it? Explain it. That is from
His Royal Highness, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I—I—you see, I—” stammered the Captain,
dazed and affrighted, “I—I am not so sure. It
may be a hoax—a trap.”</p>

<p>Von Ritter’s eyes poured out upon him their
contempt.</p>

<p>“A hoax, a trap,” he sneered. “No, no, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
it be a trap in which to catch a certain officer of the
Army who is not so very far away. I think, Captain,
that it is useless to prolong this interview,”
and he pressed an electric button in the table under
his thumb.</p>

<p>Captain Lindenwald bowed, but said nothing.</p>

<p>At the same moment the footman reappeared
and at a signal from the Chancellor lifted the
portière, and the Captain went rather shamefacedly
from the room.</p>

<p>When the Count heard the street door close he
pressed the button in the table again, and to the
footman who entered he said:</p>

<p>“Otto, I wish to speak to the Chief of Police.
Call him up, and when you have him on the telephone
let me know.”</p>

<p>He walked to the window again. The moon
had risen, and the rose garden was clad in luminous
white with trimmings of purplish grey and
black shadows.</p>

<h2><a id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Passengers</span> for Kürschdorf by the
Orient Express change cars at
Munich, which, if the train is on
time, is reached at 12.24 on the day
following the departure from Paris. On this
particular Monday the express was nearly
forty minutes late, and, as the connecting train
was timed to start at 1.02, the transfer was of
necessity accomplished with somewhat undignified
expedition. That it was accomplished at all, however,
and that the quartet, of which Carey Grey
was one, was so fortunate as to secure a compartment
to itself, were subjects for mutual congratulation.</p>

<p>The journey from the French to the Bavarian
capital had been rife with explanations. To Hope
Van Tuyl, Grey had made the entire situation most
clear, though he considerately refrained from revealing
any feature or incident that would tend to
alarm her. In his interview with Minna von Altdorf
he had brought to bear all the tact of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
he was possessed. It was no easy matter for him,
in view of his duplicity that day at Versailles, to
make her a completely veracious statement of the
facts; and it was especially difficult because of her
veneration for her great-uncle, the late Herr
Schlippenbach, whom Grey could not but regard
as an egregious knave.</p>

<p>She had been startled, surprised, pained, and
bewildered by turns as he told her the story, but
she never once questioned the truth nor doubted
the honesty of the narrator.</p>

<p>“I simply can’t understand it,” she said, with
distress in her pathetic eyes. “Why should Great-uncle
Schlippenbach do such a thing? Why
should he? How could he?”</p>

<p>“And I am just as much in the dark as you are,”
Grey answered, soothingly. “I have thought it
over continually, and I can’t arrive at any satisfactory
conclusion. I don’t remember ever having
seen him, and why he should have selected me for
this great honour—for, after all, it is an honour
to be elevated to the throne, isn’t it?” he laughed—“I
can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“We always knew he was eccentric,” the Fraü<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>lein
went on. “He had most marvellous ideas on
certain subjects, but I won’t believe he was criminal.
He must have been just a little bit insane.”</p>

<p>And then Grey asked her how it came that she
joined the little party in London.</p>

<p>“You see, Great-uncle Schlippenbach wrote me
that he was going to Budavia and asked me if I
would like to go with him and see my sister in
Kürschdorf,” she explained. “That was reasonable
enough—there was nothing insane about that,
was there? My school term had just ended, and it
was a question whether I should make my home
with my sister over here or return to America
with him.”</p>

<p>“And he told you I was your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You know I have an uncle in New
York. His name is Max Arndt. That is true.
And he told me that you were he.”</p>

<p>Grey shook his head in token of his perplexity.</p>

<p>“What became of your Great-uncle Schlippenbach’s
luggage?” he asked, suddenly, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“I have it with me,” the girl answered, frankly.
“I shall take it to my sister’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
“Have you opened it?”</p>

<p>“No. I thought that she and I would open it
together.”</p>

<p>“It is possible, you know, that it may contain
something that will give us a hint as to his motive
in this matter,” Grey said, in explanation of his
interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope so,” the Fräulein returned. “I
am so anxious about it.”</p>

<p>Grey was on the point of leaving the compartment,
when he felt a hand holding the hem of his
coat.</p>

<p>“I have just one question to ask,” said the
girl as he turned. She was not looking at him,
but she still retained her hold.</p>

<p>“Well?” he queried, laconically; and his voice
was kindly inviting.</p>

<p>“Would you mind very much if I—that is to
say, may I, still, although you are not really, but—may
I go on calling you Uncle Max?” The
hesitating embarrassment of the first part of her
utterance was followed by a nervous blurting of
the question in conclusion.</p>

<p>“I shall feel very much hurt, Minna,” Grey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
answered, “if you call me anything else.” And
he took the little hand from his coat and pressed
it affectionately.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When the train for Kürschdorf arrived at Anslingen,
on the Budavian border, there was more
than the ordinary delay. There was, moreover,
evidence of something unusual in the throng upon
the platform and the suppressed excitement of
those composing it. Johann, who had sprung out
instantly from the third-class carriage in which he
and Marcelle were travelling—his object being
to secure the passage of the party’s luggage
through the Custom House—was at once recognised
and besieged by a horde of questioners.</p>

<p>“The Prince!” they cried with one accord.
“You are with him, are you not? Where is he?
In which carriage? What is he like?” And he
had no little difficulty in shaking them off and attending
to the business in hand.</p>

<p>By some mysterious means the report had
spread, and what was at first mere rumour had
later found substantial confirmation in the discovered
presence at the station of two distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
personages: General Roederer, Commander
of the Budavian army, and Prince von
Eisenthal, conservative leader of the Budavian
Assembly; each accompanied by a more or less
gorgeously uniformed retinue.</p>

<p>Grey, looking from the carriage window, noted
the crowd with some little apprehension. He
glanced at O’Hara and saw that he too suspected
the cause. To the two ladies of the party nothing
had been said of the telegram addressed to the
name appended to the Lindenwald despatch, and
they consequently saw less of significance in the
demonstration, though they noted the gathering as
extraordinary.</p>

<p>As Grey peered at the constantly increasing
throng he wondered whether his message had
been ill-considered. He had, in a way, sent it
blindly, not knowing whether Ritter was an ally
or a dupe of the conspirators, and he had sent it
knowing that, in either event, Lindenwald was on
the spot to take whatever ground he chose and to
use whatever argument he deemed most fitting.
If the Captain so fancied he could have him arrested
on the charge of being a pretender to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
throne, and would, armed with that strong-box
left by old Schlippenbach, have small difficulty in
proving his allegation. For exoneration he himself
might appeal to his Government, but as an absconding
defaulter he could look for meagre assistance
from that quarter. O’Hara had told him it was
dangerous business, but he had spurned advice, and
now he was face to face with the consequences,
whatever they might be. He was a trifle nervous,
his heart was beating faster than its wont, and
there was a red spot in each cheek; but even while
looking on the darkest side of the picture he regretted
nothing. This crisis had to be faced in
one form or another, and he was glad the moment
for facing it had arrived.</p>

<p>There was a movement in the crowd a few
yards down the platform. The police were ordering
the people back and clearing a lane beside
the railway carriages. Grey thrust his head from
the window and saw coming down this lane, in
company with the train conductor, an army officer
in olive green uniform and black helmet. Upon
his breast was pinned a rosette of crepe, the insignia
of mourning for the dead monarch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
At the door of each first-class compartment the
two men halted for a second, asked a question and
came on. But before they reached the carriage
in which Grey was waiting, Johann, who had discerned
their object, overtook them and led the
way. Meanwhile, though Grey had not spoken,
his companions had, intuitively, or by some other
occult means, become aware of what was impending,
and sat in breathless expectation.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, before anticipation had
been quite dethroned by realization, the officer was
saluting, was being joined by his superiors and the
rest of their retinues, and Grey was standing erect
and dignified, listening to a little formal speech
of welcome from the bearded lips of Prince von
Eisenthal.</p>

<p>The crowd cheered lustily, of course, and cried:
“God save Prince Max!” And a band played
the Budavian national anthem. After which, or
rather in the midst of which, the Prince and General
Roederer entered the compartment with Grey
and his friends, their suites finding places as best
they could elsewhere, and the train, with much
ringing of bells and blowing of whistles, moved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
off into the valley of the Weisswasser, its locomotive
now gay with many Budavian flags and
streamers of red and white bunting—colours of
the royal house of Kronfeld.</p>

<p>Grey’s relief from the tension of uncertainty
found expression in an interested animation that
impressed Prince von Eisenthal most favourably.
He asked many questions concerning the affairs
of the little kingdom, both political and commercial,
and exhibited a concern over the conservative
policy of the late King that was especially
pleasing to the leader of the conservative forces.
General Roederer, meanwhile, addressed himself
to the ladies and Lieutenant O’Hara. He was a
bluff but gallant old fellow, with ruddy complexion
and iron-grey hair, and he possessed a quaint
humour that kept the little company in gay spirits
throughout the hour of the trip from the frontier
to the capital.</p>

<p>“I am deeply regretful, your Royal Highness,”
he said to Grey, as the towers and spires of
Kürschdorf came into view, “that we are not at
liberty to offer you such a demonstration on your
arrival as I should have liked. But His Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the late King, you understand, is still above sod,
the Court is in mourning, and the Prince Regent
deemed it unfitting to give you more than the most
informal of welcomes.”</p>

<p>Grey bowed his acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” he said, tactfully, “though I do
not fail to appreciate the expression of good will
in your desire. The Prince Regent’s views and
mine, in this matter, are in perfect accord.”</p>

<p>But, however well the ideas of the supposed
heir and the Prince Regent may have coincided,
the populace was by no means of the same mind.
It is not every day that a Prince of Kronfeld arrives
in Kürschdorf—not every day that a new
King comes from across the sea to take his place
as ruler of his people—and the loyal townsfolk,
despite the brevity of time between announcement
and arrival, and the expressed opposition of their
temporary ruler to anything in the nature of an
ovation, hung gay banners amid the mourning
drapery of their house fronts, closed their offices
and shops and turned out in gala dress and
mood to crowd the streets, the squares and the
cafés.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
As the train drew slowly into the railway station
Grey leaned over and took Hope’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll probably have to leave you for a little,”
he said, regretfully, “but O’Hara will see that
you get to the hotel, and I’ll try to look in this
evening.”</p>

<p>Outside the station a landau, its panels decorated
with the royal arms and drawn by six cream-white
Arabian horses in glittering, gold-mounted
harness, stood in waiting, with coachman, footman
and postillions in the purple and scarlet livery
of the Court; while thirty yards away, in line
along the opposite side of the Bahnhof Platz, was
a troop of the King’s Cuirassiers, their breastplates
and helmets of silver and gold glinting fiery
red in the glow of the sunset.</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer rang out as Grey, with the
Prince on his right and the General on his left,
passed through the station, followed by the welcoming
company that had escorted him from Anslingen,
and took his place in the waiting carriage.
And, as the little procession of which he was the
dominating feature wound through the boulevards
and streets of the new town and across the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Charlemagne bridge over the turbulent Weisswasser
into the more ancient and picturesque
quarter of the city, the cheering, it seemed to him,
grew louder and more continuous. At one point
a group of young girls in white frocks and red
ribbons ran out into the roadway to spread flowers
in the path of his equipage, and at another a
chorus of a hundred students, crowded on the balconies
of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Brauerei</i>, greeted his coming with a
patriotic glee, sung as only male voices of Teutonic
breeding and training can sing choruses.</p>

<p>Grey’s emotions during this drive were novel
and complex. There were moments when he almost
felt that he was indeed the Prince—not that
any marvellous transubstantiation had taken place,
but that he had always been so—and that all this
homage, this enthusiastic applause and adulation
were his by right; and there were moments when
his heart grew sick at the fraud, the imposition,
the error, and he knit his brows and reproached
himself for letting the deception go so far.</p>

<p>The magnitude the affair had suddenly assumed
appalled him. Heretofore he had regarded it as
a mere personal matter. He had been outraged,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
his honour sullied, his life threatened, and he was
justified, he had told himself, in using every means
within his power to bring his enemies to book.
But he had not perceived the possibilities of permitting
this line of investigation to run on unchecked.
In a single moment the adventure had
become a matter of national import. He was
guilty now of masquerading as heir to the throne
of a European monarchy. Hitherto the crime lay
at the doors of a few conspirators, who, to serve
certain nefarious ends of which he knew nothing,
had striven to secure for him the crown. In that
plot he had personally had no part. Everything
had been done without his cognisance or consent;
but now it was not they alone who were forcing
the scheme to a consummation. He had, practically,
for the time being at least, joined hands
with them and was passively allowing their plans
to be carried out, though fully aware of the impious
character of the whole proceeding.</p>

<p>And the enormity of his thoughtless offence was
at each foot of the way made more and more apparent
by these cheering masses of people. When
they should learn that they had been tricked, what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
explanation would serve to assuage their resentment?
Love and homage would be turned to
hatred and vengeance, and no excuse that he could
offer would have any weight against their sense
of outraged loyalty.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts took a new trend, and he
asked himself how it was possible that old Schlippenbach
and his fellow-plotters had been able thus
to fool the conservative leaders of a great nation
regarding a matter so vital to the very existence
of their most cherished institutions as the legitimate
succession to the regal sceptre. What incontrovertible
proofs had it been possible to offer in
order to bring about this ready acceptance of a
man whom the Budavian people had never seen to
rule over their nation’s destinies? After all, there
was where the blame must lie. The preposterousness
of the proposition, it seemed to him, should
have been apparent to the most simple-minded.</p>

<p>And, as he thought, the landau, with the flashing
cuirassiers galloping ahead and behind and
on either side, began the tortuous ascent of the
Wartburg by the wide, wooded avenues that wind
from the palace gates through the sumptuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
royal gardens up to the imposing Residenz Schloss
on the mountain’s apex. Now and then, through
rifts in the foliage, Grey got glimpses of the vast,
formidable, castle-like pile of sombre stone perched
far above him, the outline of its battlemented
towers showing sharp and clear against the pink
of the sunset-tinted sky; and it seemed to frown
forbiddingly, resembling more a great fortress at
this distance than the magnificent palace it is.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, to a musical fanfare of
bugles, a clinking of bit chains and a rattle of
steel-shod hoofs on stone paving, the carriage
swept in under the great grey <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>; the
massive oaken doors of the Schloss swung impressively
inward, and Chancellor von Ritter, in
his robes of office, with a dozen attendants at his
back, stood in token of formal welcome on the
threshold.</p>

<p>To Grey’s immense relief, however, the ensuing
formalities were of the briefest description, and
almost immediately he found himself proceeding
under the Chancellor’s guidance and direction toward
a suite of rooms in the Flag Tower that had
been prepared against his coming.</p>

<h2><a id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Grand Hotel Königin Anna at
Kürschdorf is much like the Schweitzerhof
at Lucerne. It stretches its
long, yellow front, bordered by a
stone terrace, along the wide Schloss Strasse,
on the other side of which, shaded by four
rows of leafy linden trees, is the Königin Quai,
skirting the fast-flowing Weisswasser. At one
end of the Quai is the Wartburg Brücke, and at
the other the Kursaal.</p>

<p>At about ten o’clock on the morning following
his arrival in Kürschdorf, O’Hara appeared on the
terrace with a troubled expression on his usually
care-free face and a newspaper in his hand. The
events of the previous evening had filled him with
an apprehension greater even than that which had
beset his friend. Being himself a subject of monarchical
rule, and appreciating by reason of his
breeding and environment the very serious nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of the affair, he viewed these late developments
with less leniency than would naturally temper
the consideration of a citizen of a republic, whose
knowledge of the ethics of dynasties had been
gleaned chiefly from books.</p>

<p>Grey, in allowing himself to be invested with
royal honours, had cut loose from O’Hara’s counsel.
The Crown Prince was no longer travelling
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>. He was now within the very shadow
of the throne that awaited him, and was consequently
hedged in by all the formalities of the
Court. Yesterday they were able to consult as
man to man on an equal footing. Today a gulf
divided them. It would be possible, of course, for
O’Hara to present himself at the Palace and crave
an audience, but it was doubtful whether anything
approaching a private consultation could be managed.
The American now, oddly enough, was not
his own master. Otherwise he would have come
to the hotel the evening before, as he had planned.
He belonged to the state, and, if rumour spoke
truly, he was, and had been since his arrival at the
Residenz Schloss, under the strictest surveillance.</p>

<p>There was a hint of this in the paper that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
O’Hara carried, and the very air was pregnant
with more or less detailed gossip, sensational in
the extreme. At breakfast the Irishman had overheard
a conversation at the next table to the effect
that the Crown Prince was quite mad and had
been locked in a dungeon under the Palace in the
care of a half-dozen burly wardens. Everyone
was talking on the same subject. An officer in
uniform, connected with the Royal Horse Guards,
was reported to have said that Prince Max had
attempted suicide on his way from Paris, and
O’Hara, knowing this to be untrue, discounted
most of the other tales as equally baseless. Nevertheless,
he was very considerably disturbed. He
longed to act, but realised that his hands were tied.
All that was left for him to do was to wait with
what patience he could command until something
further developed. And so he lighted a cigar and
strolled forth across the Schlosse Strasse to the
Quai, where, presently, he was joined by Miss
Van Tuyl and the Fräulein von Altdorf.</p>

<p>They, too, had heard the rumours with which
the very atmosphere was vibrant, and they came
to him with long faces seeking reassurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
“Isn’t it possible to find out something definite?”
Hope asked, plaintively. “Surely there
must be some authority somewhere. You are his
friend and you have a right to know. Why not
go to see General Roederer? Let us get a carriage
and we will all three go.”</p>

<p>“I should be only too glad, Miss Van Tuyl,”
O’Hara replied, “if I thought anything was to
be gained by it; but the truth of the matter is, you
are unnecessarily alarmed. Carey is all right.
Don’t you pay any attention to these cock-and-bull
stories. He has done this thing with his eyes
open, and if we go interfering we may upset all
his plans. We shall hear from him some time
during the day, I feel certain. But if we don’t I’ll
see that you have the facts before you sleep tonight.
By the way, have you heard from your
father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I had a telegram late last night.
He is on his way. He will be here this evening.”</p>

<p>“Good. Two heads are better than one, and
when he arrives we’ll find out what we want to
know if we have to blow up the palace to do it.
But I really feel that we shall have tidings from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
His Royal Highness before many hours.” And
he laughed in his characteristic rollicking fashion.</p>

<p>“It all seems just like a dream to me,” said
Minna, soberly. “I’m completely dazed. So
much has happened in the last week that I hardly
know what I’m doing. And now I shouldn’t stop
here another minute, for I’m sure my sister will
be at the hotel and those stupid people will not
know where to tell her to find me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go over and sit on the terrace,” suggested
O’Hara. “The band will be playing before
long, and they tell me it is a very good one.”</p>

<p>On the journey from Paris the Irishman and
the Fräulein had been much in each other’s company,
and the growth of their mutual interest had
been more than once remarked by both Grey and
Miss Van Tuyl. Now, as he gazed at her fresh
young beauty, there was a tenderness in his eyes,
the meaning of which there was no mistaking.
Hope saw it, and when the terrace was reached
she excused herself and went inside, leaving them
together.</p>

<p>“You will be going to your sister’s today, then,
I suppose,” said the soldier, when they had found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
places under the shade of an awning not too close
to the band stand and well away from the other
loungers; in his tone was regret.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Minna answered, and her accent, too,
was regretful. “Her house is to be my home
after this, you know.”</p>

<p>“And there’ll be somebody that will miss you
very much,” O’Hara ventured. His eyes had
grown worshipful, and the girl’s colour deepened
as she looked into them.</p>

<p>“And I shall miss somebody very much,” she
returned, with a tincture of coquetry; adding,
after a briefest moment, “Miss Van Tuyl is
lovely. I feel as if I had known her always.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t speaking of her,” he protested,
softly. “She’ll miss you, I dare say; but there’s
a man who’ll miss you a whole lot more—miss
you as he never thought it would be possible for
him to miss anyone.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes drooped under the ardour of his
gaze, and her cheeks flushed pinker still at his
words. Her heart fluttered with an emotion that
was new to it, and that she did not quite understand.
She had experienced it once or twice before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in lesser degree, on the train when this big, hearty,
boyish fellow had—not altogether by chance—touched
her hand. It made her mute then, and
now her tongue was again for the moment tied.</p>

<p>“But I am not going far,” she replied, when
utterance returned; “my sister’s place is only a
mile or two out of town, and the man has told me
that he is very fond of walking.”</p>

<p>“And may he come?” he pleaded, eagerly, his
face suddenly alight with the smile she had grown
to regard as not the least of his attractions.
“May he?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked, laughing lightly.</p>

<p>“Yes, why not?” he repeated, joyously.
“Since he will want to see her very much, and
since she has not denied him.”</p>

<p>Frau Fahler, Minna’s sister, was much older
than she; a woman of thirty-four at least, short,
stout and fair-haired, but with eyes of that deep
pansy blue which was a family characteristic. She
arrived about eleven o’clock in a rather quaint-looking
country wagon, and she carried off the
Fräulein almost immediately, in spite of the urging
of Hope and O’Hara that she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
stop for luncheon and delay the parting until afternoon.</p>

<p>Minna was naturally loth to leave until some
tidings had been received from the Palace, but
her sister had a dozen reasons for her haste, and
so it was arranged that when towards evening her
luggage was sent for, the messenger should be
given whatever news had arrived.</p>

<p>Hope’s anxiety meanwhile had grown with
every passing minute. O’Hara’s assurances were
well intentioned, but, backed only by surmise, they
were by no means satisfying.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he can come himself, or he
would be here,” she said, in reply to his oft-repeated
explanation that a Crown Prince is not
wholly his own master, “but he certainly could
send Johann or some one with a note.”</p>

<p>But the afternoon wore away without any message.
On the other hand, the rumours of the
morning grew more ominous. A special session
of the Budavian Assembly had been called for that
very evening. A question, it was said, had arisen
as to the legitimacy of the alleged heir apparent.
Certain members of the Royal household were reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
under arrest, charged with no less a crime
than treason. The adherents of Prince Hugo
were in the highest feather. Already the more
optimistic were speaking of him as His Majesty.
In the crowded cafés, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Brauerei</i> and the beer
gardens but the one subject was discussed; and
the newspapers got out special extras, which hinted
guardedly at the mystery, but gave absolutely no
facts.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Hope Van Tuyl drove to the
railway station and met her father. She was
nervously excited to the verge of hysteria, and
Nicholas Van Tuyl had some difficulty in piecing
together her somewhat disconnected and, it
seemed to him at times, irrational statements.
Eventually, however, by dint of careful questioning
he became acquainted with the salient points
of the situation; and later, at dinner, the Irishman
supplied what was lacking in important detail.</p>

<p>“I agree with Lieutenant O’Hara,” said Mr.
Van Tuyl, in a tone that smacked of the judicial;
“it is a very delicate problem, and one that must
be handled with the utmost care. At the same
time, my dear child, your anxiety is natural, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
though I think you have exaggerated the seriousness
of the affair, I can well understand your impatience
for facts. And facts we are going to
have.”</p>

<p>He smiled confidently, and his daughter’s face
brightened on the instant.</p>

<p>“All the time you have been telling me your
story,” he went on, “I have been trying to think
of the name of a man I met in Munich a few years
ago. He holds some high position here, and
would be just the chap to help us now. We were
excellent friends, and when we parted he begged
me to come to Kürschdorf and visit him. Strange
I can’t think of his name.”</p>

<p>“What about the American Minister?” O’Hara
suggested.</p>

<p>“I doubt that he would know. Besides, under
the circumstances, there’s no use taking chances.
If we told him the truth it would be a case of out
of the frying-pan into the fire. Grey is extraditable,
you know. I wonder if we could learn anything
by attending this Parliament meeting?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get in. I thought of that at once
and made inquiries. It’s an executive session.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Van Tuyl was silent for a minute or more, evidently
deep in thought.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you know the names of the
high monkey-monks here, do you?” he asked,
presently.</p>

<p>“I know a few,” O’Hara answered. “There’s
Prince von Eisenthal, and Herr Marscheim, and
Count von Ritter, and——”</p>

<p>“Aha!” cried the New York man, gleefully,
“now you’ve hit it. Von Ritter—Count von Ritter.
He is my Munich friend. What is he?
What position does he hold?”</p>

<p>“He is what they call Chancellor, I believe; but
in reality he’s a sort of Prime Minister.”</p>

<p>“That’s our man, by all that’s good!” Van
Tuyl exclaimed. “We’ll find where he hangs
out and call on him. And, girlie,” he added, turning
to his daughter, “you’ll know all about it in a
few hours.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be at the Assembly session, of course,”
said O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Certainly. We’ll go there and send him in a
message, and I’ll bet ten dollars to a cent he’ll
come a-running. He owes me a debt of gratitude;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
I put him in the way of placing a government loan
at very good figures when the Budavian credit
wasn’t the best in all Europe by any means.”</p>

<p>Hope smiled her gratitude. She had great faith
in her father. He was of the type of successful
Americans that do things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> apartment in the Flag Tower to
which Carey Grey was conducted by
Chancellor von Ritter was at the top
of two flights of winding stone stairs,
and the barred windows of its four rooms
commanded a view of varied and picturesque
loveliness. In the foreground were the Palace
gardens, with their series of descending terraces,
their fountains and statuary, their parterres
of gay flowers, their gracefully curving driveways
and gravelled walks, and their wonderful old trees
of every shade of green leafage. Beyond the
gardens were the red and grey roofs, the spires
and steeples and domes and turrets of the city,
divided by the sparkling silver-white waters of
the rushing river, and beyond these stretched the
fertile valley checkered with fields of ripening
grain—yellow and orange and russet—and olive
patches of woodland, and dotted with farm houses
and cottages and barns and hayricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
The rooms, themselves, were somewhat sombre.
There was a small library, panelled and finished
in black oak; a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, long and high, with much
tarnished gilt ornamentation and red upholstery;
a tiny bare dressing-room, and a bedchamber
with a great canopied bedstead, beside which stood
a quaintly carved <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prie-dieu</i>.</p>

<p>“Your Royal Highness will, I trust, be comfortable
here,” said the Chancellor, when he had
walked with Grey from one room to another and
the two were standing together in the long <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>.</p>

<p>The American hesitated a moment before replying.
He was revolving mentally several alternatives
of action. It was his duty, he knew, not to
let this farce proceed further; and yet he had thus
far learned absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>“I shall,” he said, at length, “be quite comfortable.”</p>

<p>“If there is anything your Royal Highness
desires,” continued the Chancellor, “you have but
to make it known.”</p>

<p>The invitation arrested the whirl of indecision
and settled the course of procedure.</p>

<p>“If you will be so good as to answer me a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
questions, Count,” Grey began, “I shall be indebted.
Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter found a place for his angular
length upon a settee beside a pedestalled bust of
King Oswald the First, and Grey sank into a
chair near by.</p>

<p>“I am entirely at your Royal Highness’s disposal,”
the Chancellor avowed, amiably; and the
American, not without some trepidation, it must
be confessed, began:</p>

<p>“You understand, of course, that events in my
career have followed one another in the most rapid
succession during the past few months; and regarding
some of the most important details I am
entirely uninformed. You will be surprised, perhaps,
to learn, for instance, that I do not know
with any degree of definiteness how my identity
was established. Herr Schlippenbach was my discoverer,
of course, but with whom did he consult
here and by what means was it made clear that I
am really the abducted heir of the Budavian
crown?”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter listened to the question with
growing suspicion. Here were, perhaps, the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
indications of that insanity of which Lindenwald
had spoken.</p>

<p>“It does seem hardly possible, your Royal
Highness,” he replied, “that on such a vital matter
you should have been left in ignorance. It
was, I think, nearly a year ago that the first communication
from the Herr Doctor Schlippenbach
was brought to me by Herr Professor Trent.”</p>

<p>“And who is Herr Professor Trent?” Grey
asked, quickly.</p>

<p>“The Herr Professor,” answered the Chancellor,
“is the head of the University of Kürschdorf.”</p>

<p>“And his reputation is, of course, beyond reproach,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite beyond reproach, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>“And what steps followed?” Grey pursued,
inquisitorially, crossing his legs and leaning back
in his chair.</p>

<p>“I took up the matter personally,” the Count
responded, with frankness. “I entered into correspondence
with Schlippenbach at once, and after
some months of writing back and forth he placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
before me a very circumstantial story, which he
afterward confirmed with documentary evidence—old
letters, photographs, affidavits.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“When I had thoroughly assured myself of
the authenticity of all he claimed, I brought the
subject to the attention of the Privy Council, and
eventually it was laid before His Majesty. In the
meantime the Budavian Minister at Washington
had been investigating, and the Budavian Consul
at New York as well. But all that, of course, you
know.”</p>

<p>Grey nodded, dissembling. He was studying
Count von Ritter as he spoke; noting every accent,
every inflection, every expression, in an endeavour
to decide whether he were innocent or guilty. Thus
far he had been inclined to regard him as honest.
It hardly seemed possible that one occupying his
position could stoop to such chicanery. And the
head of the university appeared likewise as too
impregnably placed to be open to suspicion. The
Budavian Minister and the Budavian Consul,
however, he concluded could not be guiltless.</p>

<p>“And how did Captain Lindenwald chance to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
be chosen to meet me on my arrival in England?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Captain Lindenwald,” answered the Chancellor,
“is an officer of the Royal household—he was
the late King’s equerry—and he is, moreover, the
brother of our Minister to the United States.”</p>

<p>Grey smiled in spite of himself. Of Lindenwald’s
complicity he had had no doubt from the
first. The fact that the Budavian Minister at
Washington was his brother made it all the more
probable that that dignitary was also criminally
involved.</p>

<p>“Now, just one more matter, Count,” the
American continued. “Can you tell me anything
of this Baron von Einhard?”</p>

<p>The Chancellor shrugged his square shoulders.</p>

<p>“The Baron is a supporter of Prince Hugo,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“That much I know,” Grey returned. “And
in his loyalty to his leader he is apt to be unscrupulous
to the Prince’s opponents?”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter smiled a trifle cynically.</p>

<p>“I have been led to understand so,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“He would pay well, I suppose, to get Prince
Max out of the way just at this juncture? Is it
not so?”</p>

<p>“The price asked would probably not deter him.”</p>

<p>“And Captain Lindenwald—But no, of course
not. It is silly of me to suggest such a possibility.
You are satisfied of that officer’s fealty, I am
sure?”</p>

<p>The Chancellor straightened in his seat and
leaned forward with an exhibition of concern that
had hitherto been lacking.</p>

<p>“You do not make yourself altogether clear,
your Royal Highness,” he ventured. “Am I to
understand that you have reason to suspect that
Captain Lindenwald and the Baron von Einhard
are——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” interrupted Grey, pleased nevertheless
at the awakened interest of the Chancellor,
“I did not say so. I merely asked a question.
You are satisfied of Captain Lindenwald’s entire
honesty and loyalty, are you not?”</p>

<p>“The Captain,” von Ritter replied, guardedly,
“has not been as eager as I could have wished at
times, but I have never regarded him as venal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“Then his explanation of why he left me in
Paris, without so much as a word as to his going,
and why that night an attempt was made to abduct
me by persons in the employ of Baron von
Einhard—I suppose he has made such an explanation—was
entirely satisfactory to you?”</p>

<p>Grey sprung the question suddenly and noted
scrutinisingly the effect.</p>

<p>The Chancellor’s usually immobile features
gave perceptible token of his surprise. His bushy
brows raised the merest trifle, and his keen black
eyes widened.</p>

<p>“His story was, I must confess, not altogether
satisfactory, your Royal Highness,” he answered,
quietly; “it was, I may say, lacking in detail.”</p>

<p>“I would suggest,” continued Grey, in a tone
equally repressed, “that you question him in the
line I have indicated.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor bowed.</p>

<p>“I have to thank you,” he said, gravely. “I
shall do so. That is very certain.”</p>

<p>Grey arose and Count von Ritter got to his feet
instantly. The American stood for a moment in
indecision, very tall, very erect. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
denying that he looked every inch the Prince.
Whether to declare that he was not he hurriedly
debated. Meanwhile the Chancellor was still
striving to detect the madness of which Lindenwald
had spoken. To each question he had given
the most searching mental scrutiny; to each gesture,
to each intonation he had paid the closest
heed, but he had discovered practically no indication
of the malady charged. With Grey’s next
utterance, however, all the fabric of his assurance
fell crumbling.</p>

<p>“Count von Ritter,” he said—he had been for
a moment gazing out through the window at the
varied landscape now dimming with the dusk, but
as he spoke he turned and faced the Chancellor—“Count
von Ritter, I can delay no longer in confiding
to you a matter so grave that I scarcely
know how to frame it in words. May I ask you
to again be seated?” And he waved his hand
towards the settee from which the Count had
risen.</p>

<p>The Chancellor seated himself without speaking,
and Grey resumed his place in the chair near
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
“The reason I have asked you what I have,”
continued he, speaking slowly and with more
than his usual deliberation, “is that I have been—I
was about to say astounded, but that is too
weak a word—I have been stunned and dumfounded
by the proved credulity of a nation which
has the reputation, next to Russia, of possessing
the most astute diplomats in all Europe. That a
government so fortified could be tricked into placing
its sceptre in the hands of an American citizen,
whose ancestry shows no trace of Budavian
blood and whose antecedents are an open book,
seems out of all reason; and yet it is precisely
what you and your confrères, Count, have, as is
now conclusively evidenced, been led into.”</p>

<p>Upon the Chancellor’s face was an expression
which Grey could not fathom. He was neither
startled nor incensed. There was, indeed, just
the faintest suspicion of amusement in his keen
black eyes, mingled with a spirit of kindly indulgence.</p>

<p>“You mean,” he said, quietly, “that you are
not the heir?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” Grey answered, in amazement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
at his companion’s inscrutable manner, “I
am no more the Prince of Kronfeld than I am the
Prince of Wales. I am Carey Grey, of New York,
an American born and bred, who was drugged,
hypnotised, mesmerised or what you please; made
unknowingly to commit a theft, made unknowingly
to cross the Atlantic, to travel under a false
name, to attempt to usurp a title and a throne.”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter’s foot tapped the floor nervously.
He laced his long, knotted fingers and unlaced
them again.</p>

<p>“This is a very grave matter,” he said, his
voice low and steady, “and I shall lose no time
in looking into it. As you say, such a thing would
appear beyond the bounds of reason. Your Royal
High—I beg your pardon! Mr. Grey, did I understand?”
And there was a humouring leniency,
not to say pity, in his tone—“you can
imagine how much this statement of yours at this
late hour will involve in the way of complications.”</p>

<p>“That you were not enlightened earlier,
Count,” Grey continued, “was due to my desire
to learn just how far the conspiracy had been carried.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
As a matter of fact, until I reached Anslingen
this afternoon I had no positive assurance
that the affair had gone further than Herr Schlippenbach
and Captain Lindenwald. Of their intentions
I was well satisfied, but concerning the
chances for the ultimate success of their plans I
was in the dark.”</p>

<p>Again the two men stood up.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the Chancellor, “as to dinner.
A state banquet has been prepared at which your—pardon
me!—at which <em>His</em> Royal Highness
was to have presided. Under the circumstances,
however, I presume you would prefer not to attend.
If I may be permitted,” he added, tactfully,
“I will explain that His Royal Highness is indisposed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Grey acquiesced, cheerily;
“that’s the better course—the only course, in fact.
Unless you can yourself join me—and I suppose
that is impossible—I’ll dine alone here. And afterward
I should like a conveyance to the Hotel
Königin Anna. I have some friends there that I
must see this evening.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor bowed. The next moment he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
was gone, and Grey crossed to the open window
and stood for a long while lost in thought. Meanwhile
the gloom deepened over the valley and the
room behind him grew dark.</p>

<p>He was awakened from his reverie by a rapping
on the door, and in response to his permission to
enter Johann came in, followed by porters with
his luggage. Then the candles were lighted, and
a little later his dinner was served.</p>

<p>Afterward he got into his evening clothes, and
when he was quite ready he sent Johann to see if
the carriage he had ordered was in waiting. But
the boy returned with dismay mantling his usually
placid features.</p>

<p>“The carriage is not coming, your Royal
Highness,” he said, with an accent of apology, as
though the fault was his.</p>

<p>“Not coming?” Grey repeated in astonishment.
“Why is it not coming?”</p>

<p>“None has been ordered, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>“Then order one at once.”</p>

<p>“I tried to, your Royal Highness; but I was
not permitted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Grey’s customary calmness gave way to palpable
irritation.</p>

<p>“What the devil do you mean?” he asked.
“Am I a prisoner here?”</p>

<p>Johann’s distress increased.</p>

<p>“It is not I, your Royal Highness, on whom
the blame lies. Outside this door is a guard. He
will not let me pass. He will not let your Royal
Highness pass. He has orders.”</p>

<p>The American strode angrily towards the door.</p>

<p>“We will see,” he said, determinedly.</p>

<p>Outside a soldier was standing.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he asked, in as repressed
a tone as he could muster. “Why will
you not let my man do as I bid him?”</p>

<p>The sentry saluted respectfully.</p>

<p>“I have been ordered by my commanding officer,
your Royal Highness,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Ordered to what?” cried Grey.</p>

<p>“Ordered, your Royal Highness, to permit no
one to leave the Flag Tower.”</p>

<p>And he saluted again.</p>

<h2><a id="XVII"></a>XVII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> realisation that he was a prisoner
aroused in Carey Grey a spirit of revolt.
He thought that he had calculated
the cost. He had foreseen that
his confession would bring about complications,
and had counted on perhaps a long and
trying investigation, but he had not imagined
that he would be deprived of his liberty pending
the question’s settlement. The fact that he had
been honest should of itself, he argued, have entitled
him to consideration; but his frankness had
been misjudged and his candour rewarded with
punishment.</p>

<p>Smarting under the indignity, he wrote a witheringly
sarcastic note to Count von Ritter, and
demanded that the guard should see to its expeditious
delivery. At the end of an hour he received
a brief reply:</p>

<p>“The Chancellor,” it read, “regrets deeply that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
he is unable to aid Mr. Grey. The Chancellor repeated
his interview of the early evening to His
Highness, the Prince Regent, and it is by His
Highness’s command that the present temporary
restraint exists.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Grey set about devising some means
of escape; but the barred windows and the armed
guard, which, he learned from Johann, was not
alone at his door but on the landings above and below
and surrounding the Tower as well, were seemingly
insurmountable obstacles. He thought of
bribery, and as an entering wedge endeavoured to
have a note taken to Miss Van Tuyl, offering a
sum of money out of all proportion to the service,
but the offer was phlegmatically declined.</p>

<p>It was very late before he threw himself upon
the great high bed in the dingy bedchamber and
tried to snatch a few hours’ sleep; and he was up
again at dawn. But if his slumber had been brief,
Johann’s had even been briefer. He had spent
hours in conversation with the soldier in the passage,
and he had gathered at least one fact of interest,
if not of importance—there were other
prisoners on the floor above. How many, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
unable to learn, and of the strength of the guard
he was also uninformed. There would be a
change, though, at seven o’clock, and then it
would be possible to ascertain.</p>

<p>From the window of the library which was over
the Tower door the approach of the relief and the
departure of the night watch could be seen. The
bars were too close to permit of a head being
thrust between them, but the barracks were at
some distance from the Palace, and the route,
Johann said, lay diagonally across the uppermost
terrace in full view of this particular window.
There Grey watched, and promptly at seven, as
the bell in the Bell Tower on another corner of
the quadrangle clanged the hour, a cornet sounded
and seven armed infantry men came marching
over the stone pavement. That, he concluded,
meant one man on each of the three landings and
four men on guard below. Not counting the
guard on the floor above, there were six against
two, and escape under these conditions appeared
hopeless. If, however, the prisoners on the floor
above could be communicated with and a plan of
concerted action agreed upon there might be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
fighting chance of success. But the question was,
how to reach them. The ceilings were high and
the floors thick, and to invent and execute a code
of signals by rapping would be a tedious and not
at all promising undertaking. Nevertheless Grey
was more than half inclined to try it. By piling
one piece of furniture on another the ceiling could
be reached readily enough, and by giving each
letter of the alphabet its number it would be possible
to hammer out words. Those above might
not be able to hear or, hearing, might not be clever
enough to understand, but the American was desperate,
and, notwithstanding the odds against
him, he determined after some little consideration
to make the effort.</p>

<p>Upon a large table in the centre of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> he
and Johann lifted a smaller one which they
brought from the library, and upon this in turn
they placed a chair. To the top of this edifice
Grey climbed, armed with a heavy walking-stick,
with which he began a series of regular and irregular
blows upon the heavy oaken panelling which
ceiled the room. Having continued this for something
like three minutes without intermission, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
paused in the hope of some response. But none
was forthcoming, and he repeated the signalling
with increased vigour. When he halted again
there was a distinct reply—an exact reproduction,
in fact, of his rhythm—and the serious, anxious
expression he had worn gave way to one of relief,
if not indeed of triumph.</p>

<p>His next move was to repeat in strokes the entire
alphabet, beginning with one for A, two for
B, and so on. This was a long and rather laborious
operation, but when he had finished he was
given the prompt gratification of an alert understanding
from those above, for immediately taking
the cue, the answering thuds spelled out the word
“window,” and turning his glance in the direction
of the barred casement he saw hanging there,
at the end of an improvised string made of torn
and tied strips of linen, a fluttering piece of paper.</p>

<p>With a single bound he reached the floor, and
the next instant he was reading with eager interest
the pencilled words:</p>

<p>“Write what you wish to say, attach it, pull
gently twice, and we will raise it.”</p>

<p>“Johann,” he cried, enthusiastically, “see this!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
If those fellows have as much nerve as they have
wit we’ll soon be out of here, all right.”</p>

<p>And while Johann read and smiled his approval
Grey sat down and wrote.</p>

<p>For an hour or more questions and answers,
propositions and suggestions, went back and forth
from floor to floor by means of this novel line of
communication, and by the end of that time a
complete scheme of escape with all its details had
been arranged and was mutually understood.</p>

<p>There were two prisoners above—a gentleman
and his man; just as there were two prisoners
below—a gentleman and his man. Who the two
gentlemen were was not asked by either. That
they were guarded in the Flag Tower was proof
that their offences were political merely. Nevertheless,
the two gentlemen resented the indignity
put upon them, and both were anxious to escape.
The two men were loyal to their masters and could
be depended upon to act with valour. The gentleman
above was unarmed, but the gentleman below
had a revolver. The time agreed upon for the
delivery was two o’clock in the morning. As that
hour sounded from the Bell Tower the guards on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
their respective floors were to be called in on some
pretext, overpowered and stripped of their uniforms,
which would be donned by the two gentlemen.
Their weapons would be appropriated, likewise,
and thus disguised and armed it would be
comparatively easy to make captive the guard on
the first landing. There would then remain but
the four soldiers outside the Tower, and the
chances of their subduing were largely in favour
of the prisoners, three of whom would by this
time be as well equipped as the watch, while the
fourth would have Grey’s revolver. The advantage
is invariably with the surprising party, and
the plan was to take the guardsmen unawares and
effect their capture before they were even conscious
of attack.</p>

<p>All this having been definitely decided on there
was nothing to do but wait, and the hours, for
Grey at least, dragged interminably. Again and
again at intervals he rehearsed the plan with Johann,
so that there could be no possible chance of
error, but this after a while grew monotonous and
he looked about for something interesting to read.
The books he found in the library, however, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
not diverting. They were for the most part historical
and written in the heaviest of German;
nevertheless their very ponderousness was in a
way an advantage. They provoked somnolence,
and late in the afternoon the uninterested reader
fell asleep and was so snugly wrapped in slumber
when his dinner was brought in that Johann found
it a rather difficult task to rouse him. He had
slept but little the night before, and his rest on the
train the night previous to that had been broken
and fitful. His nerves needed just this repose,
and when he finally awakened it was with a clearer
eye and a steadier hand. He ate heartily of the
distinctively Teutonic dishes that were provided,
and when he finished he remarked to Johann on
his general fitness, indulging in an Americanism
which the valet vainly tried to interpret.</p>

<p>“I feel tonight, Johann,” he said, stretching
himself with arms extended and fists doubled,
“that I could lick my weight in wildcats and
paint whole townships red.”</p>

<p>As the hours wore away he sat with one leg
thrown over the arm of his chair, smoking placidly
and with evident enjoyment. It was not until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
some time after the Bell Tower had bellowed its
single note that Grey alluded to the business of
the night.</p>

<p>“Everything is ready, is it, Johann?” he asked;
“where are the thongs you made from the
sheet?”</p>

<p>“Safe in my coat pockets, your Highness,” the
youth answered.</p>

<p>“Now you may bring me my revolver,” the
American continued; “it is on the cheffonier in
my dressing-room.”</p>

<p>The revolver was brought, and Grey examined
its chambers once again to make sure that it was
fully loaded. Then, throwing the end of his cigar
through an open window, he lighted a cigarette
and continued in desultory talk with his valet.</p>

<p>A few minutes before two he rose and went into
his dressing-room, which separated the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> from
the bedchamber. In the latter candles were alight,
but the dressing-room was in darkness. He
stepped behind the curtains, close to the wall, and
stood there, silent, hidden, and shortly from the
Bell Tower solemnly sounded the hour. Simultaneously
Johann tried the door which gave from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the little library on to the landing. But it was
locked and bolted from without. Then he hammered
loudly, a little excitedly; and very promptly
the bolt was drawn and the key turned.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he cried to the guard, who swung
open the heavy oaken planking. “Quick! His
Royal Highness is ill! I fear that he is dying!
Come!” And he started off hurriedly, the soldier
following unsuspectingly.</p>

<p>In a second the little comedy was played. At
the entrance to the dressing-room Johann stepped
back and the guardsman went in ahead, to find his
arms caught in a flash from behind by Grey and
held hard and fast in spite of his struggles, while
Johann slung about his wrists the heavy linen
thongs and knotted them with deft and muscular
hands. Meanwhile the fellow was kicking and
stamping viciously, but, barring a barked shin for
Johann and a bruised toe for Grey, the effects
were not material. And, once his arms were
bound and the glittering barrel of the revolver
brought to his attention, his rebellion ceased.
Then Johann bound his feet as well, having first
marched him into the bedchamber and compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
him, protesting, to stretch himself upon the high,
old-fashioned bed.</p>

<p>Grey was in the act of unbuckling the captive’s
belt when a pistol shot, muffled but unmistakable,
echoed from overhead, and he stopped, breathless,
just as a hoarse shriek split the silence which for
an instant followed the report. The door from
the library to the landing had been left open, and
from that direction now came a scuffle of feet on
stone, mingled with a succession of crashing,
thumping, jolting noises, alarmed shouts and
angry imprecations.</p>

<p>Through the three connecting rooms Grey
dashed, revolver in hand and with Johann close
at his heels. The lantern the guard had left on
the landing had been knocked over and was out,
but by the light from the open doorway they at
once discovered the huddled, distorted body of a
man, whose groans added to the bedlam of hurrying
feet and excited voices from below and oaths,
cries, and sounds of struggle from above.</p>

<p>And as they looked there came bounding down
the stairs, by jumps of a half-dozen or more steps
at a time, another figure, followed by futile shot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
after shot from rapidly belching revolver and rifle.
The fugitive’s feet landed on the groaning,
doubled heap on the landing, and that he did not
stumble to his death was a miracle. But he kept
his balance, flashed by down the next winding
flight, and, striking the first of the ascending
guards, toppled him backwards against his followers.</p>

<p>For the space of a heart-beat Grey and Johann
paused, staring at each other. In that instant of
his passing both had recognised the fleeing prisoner.
It was Captain Lindenwald.</p>

<p>And then, as they stood inert, the guard from
above, his rifle still smoking, reached the landing,
tripped over the crumpled body and went staggering,
lurching, clutching at the air, towards the
confusion below.</p>

<p>The moment for action had now come; and
Grey, calm and collected in spite of the flurry of
events, motioning to Johann to follow, ran swiftly
down the stone stairs, which, once they were out
of the meagre glow from the library, grew dark
as Erebus. The struggling, swearing, wriggling
mass blocked the way at the next landing, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Grey and the lad, guided by the sounds, were not
taken unawares. They were, moreover, for the
moment on their feet, which no one of the others
was; and though they were caught by desperate
hands and more than once dragged to their knees,
their clothing torn and ripped, their hands
scratched, and their arms and legs wellnigh disjointed,
they kept their wits and gained the last
flight of steps without serious injury.</p>

<p>Down this they veritably hurled themselves,
and with no further impediment to delay them
reached the open door of the Tower and dashed
out onto the stone flagging of the upper terrace,
into the brilliant starlight of the early morning.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” said Grey, inhaling deeply
of the cool, clear air; and catching Johann’s sleeve
he pulled him back into the shadow of the buttress.
“But,” he added, “we are not free yet, are we?
The gates of the Palace Gardens are locked at
night, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Royal Highness,” the youth answered.</p>

<p>“Never mind that Royal Highness business
now, Johann,” he directed; “Herr Arndt will do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
for the present. I’m no more a Royal Highness
than you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt,” acquiesced Johann, imperturbably,
without change of tone, “and the
walls are very high.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, we had better move on in the
direction of some exit,” Grey advised, in a whisper;
“it won’t do to stop here. They may come
rushing down on us at any minute. You know
the way; you lead.”</p>

<p>Johann started off to the right, hugging the
Tower walls, and Grey followed. At a distance
of fifty yards they came to a clump of shrubbery,
into which the younger man plunged with Grey
still close behind. Through this a gravelled path
led into a wood, under the trees of which they
walked in silence for at least a quarter of an hour,
their course one of gradual descent.</p>

<p>“Without our hats we’ll be suspicious figures
in the streets of Kürschdorf,” Grey observed, despondently,
as they came out upon a driveway,
“and our recapture is certain. After all, I don’t
see that we have gained a very great deal. The
gates won’t be open till morning, and by that time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
if we are not captured inside, every exit will be
guarded against us. Are the walls too high to
scale?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt,” answered Johann, respectfully,
but he did not slacken his pace.</p>

<p>“What do you propose, then? Come, now,
this is serious. You know every inch of ground
here, don’t you? Is there no way we can get
out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Arndt,” came the stereotyped
answer.</p>

<p>“There is? Then why didn’t you say so?
How? In God’s name, Johann, how?”</p>

<p>The youth halted and turned.</p>

<p>“At the head gardener’s is a long ladder,” he
answered; “we are going to the head gardener’s,
Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>At the head gardener’s they very shortly arrived.
Johann’s familiarity with the place was
now more than ever evident. Without hesitation
he entered one of the larger greenhouses, the door
of which stood invitingly ajar, and, though it was
quite dark within, he very promptly laid his hand
upon a ladder which lay stretched against the wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to the right of the entrance. Having thus assured
himself that it was in its usual place, he groped
to the left and from a row of pegs there secured
two hats; one of green felt and the other of dark
straw, soiled and dilapidated, it is true, but in
the present strait of the fugitives of inestimable
value.</p>

<p>The high wall of the garden was, it subsequently
developed, but a stone’s throw distant,
and the work of carrying and placing the ladder,
climbing to the coping and springing over onto
the border of soft turf without was a matter of a
very few minutes.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Grey, as with the faded and
stained green hat upon his head he stood looking
up and down the dark, silent street, “where are
we to go? Our presence at a hotel would simply
invite detection. It is too early for me to call on
the American Minister. All of your usual haunts
will be searched before sunrise.”</p>

<p>“The sister of the Fräulein von Altdorf,” suggested
Johann, “to whom the Fräulein herself
was going, lives in the country, about two miles
away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
“You know where?” cried Grey, delightedly;
“you can find it?”</p>

<p>“I know it well,” answered the youth; “at the
next farm I was born, Herr Arndt.”</p>

<p>“Then we will go there, by all means.”</p>

<p>And they set off walking rapidly through the
narrow side streets of the old town to the bridge
of Charlemagne, and thence across the river, and
on through the wider avenue of the new city out
into the silent lanes of the sweet-scented suburbs.</p>

<p>Both were busy with their thoughts and neither
was inclined to conversation. After twenty minutes’
trudging, however, Grey asked:</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that fellow on the landing
will die, Johann?”</p>

<p>“That fellow?” repeated the valet, “which,
Herr Arndt? Do you mean Lutz?”</p>

<p>“Lutz!” exclaimed Grey, surprisedly, “was
Lutz there?”</p>

<p>“Of a certainty, Herr Arndt. Did you not see
his face? It was Lutz who lay outside our door.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> rumoured meeting of the Budavian
Assembly proved, like many other
rumoured events, to be a canard, the
only foundation for which was a
hastily called session of the Privy Council. Before
this august body, over which the Prince
Regent presided, Chancellor von Ritter laid all
the facts that had come into his possession;
and very startling facts they were, including a
confiscated letter from Baron von Einhard addressed
to Captain Lindenwald, telling of the
failure of the abduction plot and of the securing
of that precious heirloom, the signet ring of the
Prince of Kronfeld.</p>

<p>This communication gave indubitable proof
that Lindenwald had been false to his trust, and it
fully justified the Chancellor in having him placed
under arrest. It did not tend, however, to throw
any light on the mystifying main question. Was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the man who had been welcomed with such acclaim
on the previous evening really the Crown
Prince, as every bit of evidence up to the time of
his arrival tended to prove, or was he, as he
claimed, simply the cat’s-paw of a company of
conscienceless conspirators?</p>

<p>The von Einhard letter would in a way indicate
that his title was clear and genuine, as, had it been
otherwise, there would have been no necessity to
conspire with Lindenwald to bring about his abduction.
Yet, if Lindenwald knew him to be the
Crown Prince, why should he run the risk of dickering
with the Baron, seeing that greater good
fortune than he could possibly hope to earn by
such a course lay in the direction of his faithful
carrying out of his mission?</p>

<p>Upon these points the Privy Council debated
long and eagerly, if not altogether wisely. Men
are slow to confess even to themselves that they
have been imposed upon, and the State Council
had months before by an overwhelming majority
declared its faith in the integrity of the claimant.
It was, therefore, no more than to be expected
that the majority should still favour the theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
that Prince Max, in his assertion that he was
simply a plain American citizen, was labouring
under an hallucination. There had been a strain
of dementia in the ruling line for seven generations,
and this exhibition of mental malady was to
those who now recalled the fact but another evidence
of legitimacy.</p>

<p>On the minority who were known to be partial
to Prince Hugo the proof of von Einhard’s treachery
served as an effective gag. They could not
afford to imply sympathy for such conduct by opposition
to the ruling notion; and so it happened
that, while every phase of the question was discussed
with much earnestness, there was ever an
underlying sentiment that promised but one conclusion—the
unqualified endorsement of the fancied
unfortunately demented young Prince in the
Flag Tower.</p>

<p>As the session was approaching its close, a card
was brought to Count von Ritter. The Chancellor,
however, deeply interested in the speech of
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which was then
in progress, laid it on the table before him without
adjusting his glasses to read it, and had it not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
for the dullness of the speech of the Secretary of
War which followed, the session would probably
have come to a vote and adjourned before he gave
it heed. But as it chanced, bored by the prosiness
of the speaker, he took up the piece of pasteboard,
placed his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pince-nez</i> on the bridge of his nose, and
read the name: “Mr. Nicholas Van Tuyl,” with
a pencil scrawl beneath: “Your friend of Munich
and the Monterossan War Loan.” Whereupon
he arose instantly and tip-toed from the
Council Hall into the ante-room adjoining, where
Van Tuyl and O’Hara were with some impatience
waiting.</p>

<p>Their reception by Count von Ritter was cordial
in the extreme. The sentiment of the Council had
served to lift a load from his shoulders, and he
was in fine good humour.</p>

<p>“Remember you!” he cried, wringing Van
Tuyl’s hand, his small eyes alight, “of course I
remember you; and my debt to you, too—Budavia’s
debt to you. Why, my dear sir, you should
have had a decoration. The late King was very
remiss in not sending you one. But we will do
what we can to make up for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
“Ah,” returned the New York banker, “you are
very good indeed, Count, and I am going to hold
you to your word. Lieutenant O’Hara and I have
come for something this evening—something we
want very much, and something I feel sure you
can give us.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor bowed and stretched forth his
hands with palms upturned and open, in signal of
his willingness to give.</p>

<p>“What we desire,” continued Nicholas Van
Tuyl, smiling his recognition, “is information.
There are many sensational reports abroad, as
you probably know; but we men of finance are in
the habit of discounting unverified rumours. We
are not credulous. We want facts with an authority
to back them up. We want confirmation or
denial.”</p>

<p>Von Ritter’s geniality was still fervent.</p>

<p>“You wish to know, for instance—” he invited.</p>

<p>“We wish to know, Count, whether there is
any basis for the story that His Royal Highness,
Prince Maximilian, is being restrained of his liberty.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor smiled a little patronisingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
“Do they say that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That is the least they say,” Van Tuyl returned.</p>

<p>For a moment Count von Ritter hesitated.</p>

<p>“May I, without discourtesy, inquire why you
are interested?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“We are interested,” answered the New
Yorker, promptly, “because he is our personal
friend. I have known him for years, and Lieutenant
O’Hara here has been with him, he tells me,
continually from the day he left America.”</p>

<p>The three were still standing; but now the
Chancellor motioned his visitors to be seated.</p>

<p>“You in turn interest me,” he said, as he took
a chair and sat down facing them. “How long,
Mr. Van Tuyl, have you known him? For how
many years?”</p>

<p>“Ten at least,” was the answer. “He came
down to the Street when he was twenty. He was
with Dunscomb &amp; Fiske in 1893, I remember.”</p>

<p>“The Street?” repeated the Count, questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Wall Street. You knew he was a Wall
Street stock broker, didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
The Chancellor paled perceptibly, his eyes widened
a trifle and the straight line of his lips narrowed
under his close-cropped moustache.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he returned, diplomatically, after an
instant’s pause. “Yes. His name, I think, was
Grey, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Grey. Yes, Carey Grey.”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter cleared his throat and then for
a moment he sat in silence, his lids half-closed,
his mouth tight-drawn. When he spoke it was
very seriously, with a changed demeanour.</p>

<p>“Budavia has still more for which to thank
you, Mr. Van Tuyl,” he said, rising.</p>

<p>The New York banker and the Irish lieutenant
also stood up. It was evident to both that a blunder
had been made.</p>

<p>“I don’t just see for what,” said the older man,
a little nervously. “I haven’t told you anything
you didn’t know. I didn’t come here to tell you
anything. I came to have you tell me something.”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied the Count, with an urbanity
that was the acme of trained diplomacy, “that you
said just now you came here to confirm a rumour,
or words to that effect. You have, my dear sir,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
confirmed it. And now I must ask you to excuse
me. You are at the Königin Anna, I suppose?
I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor bowed, smiling, and before Van
Tuyl could remonstrate had disappeared into the
Hall of Council. And then it was that O’Hara
for the first time found words.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” he said. And he said it
with emphasis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Colonial Secretary had finished
his wearying oration and the Prince Regent had
suggested the advisability of adjournment. But
the return of the Chancellor, craving the privilege
of the floor, awakened a new interest. His usually
immobile face was portentous in its marked
gravity, and when he spoke every ear was alert.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” he began, addressing the
Prince Regent, “I am come to cry ‘Pause!’ I
have listened to and taken part in a debate this
evening the sole purpose of which, as I regard it
now, has been to accomplish our own convincing.
We constructed a theory upon a basis as unstable
as the sands of the sea, and then marshalled arguments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of straw to effect its establishment. In the
whole history of Budavia I know of no incident
of parallel puerility. We call ourselves statesmen,
and we have acted with the confiding innocence
of children. We gambolled like foolhardy
lads blindfold upon the brink of a precipice,
over which, had not a miracle intervened, we
must have fallen into the slough of ignominious
dishonour. Even as it is the smirch of its miasma
is upon us, and we cannot escape the ridicule that
is entailed.</p>

<p>“Our supposed mad Prince Maximilian of
Kronfeld, now so carefully guarded in the Flag
Tower, your Highness, is, I make bold to announce,
a perfectly sane American gentleman and
nothing more.”</p>

<p>The Prince Regent leaned suddenly forward,
his hands clutching the arms of his chair. The
other members of the Council stirred, changed
their positions; two of them got onto their feet.
But the Chancellor still standing, the Prince
Regent motioned them back to their places, and
the speaker continued:</p>

<p>“In the chain of evidence I have, within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
past five minutes, found a broken link. The statements
made to me by the supposed heir have, in
one important particular, been verified to my entire
satisfaction, and these statements were, as
you know, at utter variance with what we had
been led to believe was the truth—in direct contradiction
to the alleged proofs of royal birth.”</p>

<p>“But, your Excellency,” protested the Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, rising again, “is not
this simply jumping from one conclusion to another?”</p>

<p>The Chancellor frowned grimly.</p>

<p>“At first glance,” he replied, resting the tips of
his long, knotted fingers on the table between
them, “it may appear so. But a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link, and this link, as I have
stated, has been shattered into infinitesimal
atoms.”</p>

<p>Count von Ritter spoke for fully an hour. He
reviewed the affair from the beginning, detailing
every step in the building up of the fabric and
demonstrating with marked effect how a single
pin-prick had brought about its total collapse.
The pretender—if he could be so called in view<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of the fact that he personally had laid no claim
to the throne, but, on the other hand, had of his
own free will protested against the honour they
would have forced upon him—should be quietly
deported, and as expeditiously as possible arrangements
effected for the coronation of Prince Hugo.
The detection and punishment of those involved
in the plot to steal the crown must be brought
about with all the secrecy possible. Already two
of the conspirators, he announced, were under
arrest, and the apprehension of others would
speedily follow.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when the Council
adjourned, and the Chancellor returned to his
ancient mansion on the Graf Strasse. Rest for
him, however, was not yet to come. Upon the
writing table in his library were many State
papers demanding his attention, and, aided by his
secretary, who had been awaiting his home-coming,
he went systematically to work to clear away
the more important before retiring.</p>

<p>At a quarter past two he threw down his quill
and leaned back in his chair with a yawn.</p>

<p>“That will do for tonight, Heinrich,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
kindly, “I’m sorry to have had to keep you up so
long.”</p>

<p>And as he spoke the telephone rang long, loud
and viciously. The secretary put the receiver to
his ear, and answered into the mouthpiece. The
Count rose and stretched himself. It was unusual
for the telephone to ring at that hour, and he wondered,
watching Heinrich’s face. He saw the
young man’s chin drop and his eyes suddenly
grow round.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency!” he exclaimed, excitement
in his voice. “Your Excellency! Listen! The
Crown Prince has escaped from the Flag Tower,
together with his servant and Captain Lindenwald.
And the Captain’s man has been shot,
seriously—they think fatally. One of the guards
was found bound in His Royal Highness’s apartment.
Another guard has a broken leg, and three
others are slightly injured.”</p>

<h2><a id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> following day was rife with revelations.
Grey and Johann had arrived
at the farmhouse of Herr Fahler before
cock-crow and had been greeted
first with a yelping of dogs and then by a
cheery, if somewhat sleepy, welcome from the
master of the house, to whom Minna had told the
whole wonderful story. Johann he had recognised
at once, and he had suspected the identity
of his companion at sight. From a great cask in
the corner of the big living-room he had drawn
them foaming beakers of beer, and from a cupboard
had produced for their further refreshment
some cold meat and dark bread. And as they ate
and drank, Frau Fahler had appeared to add her
welcome to her husband’s, and a little later the
Fraülein, with rosy cheeks fresh from slumber
and wearing the most becoming of negligées, had
enthusiastically thrown her arms about Grey’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
neck and mingled tears of joy with her smiles
over “Uncle Max’s” deliverance.</p>

<p>At daybreak the fugitive Crown Prince wrote
a note to Hope, telling her of his flight and his
place of refuge, and one of the farm hands was
despatched with it to the town. Then Minna suggested
that the two refugees needed rest, and was
for sending them to bed for a few hours’ sleep,
but Grey protested and Johann blankly refused.</p>

<p>In the American’s mind one desire was now
dominant—to see the contents of the late Herr
Schlippenbach’s luggage, among which, he was
impressed, he would find some clue to the mystery—some
evidence, perhaps, that would make clear
what was still the most perplexing of enigmas.
Whether this impression was born of hope,
merely, or whether it was inspired by some
psychic manifestation cannot be demonstrated and
is not material; but, as the discoveries of the day
proved, it was well founded.</p>

<p>After the family breakfast, which was served
early, Minna took Grey to an upper room where
were the three boxes of her great-uncle, and producing
the keys a thorough search was made of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the dead man’s effects. In one box were his
clothes, in another relics of his family, and in the
third a small library of books and manuscripts,
with many bottles and jars and boxes, wrapped in
straw and packed with consummate care to guard
against breakage.</p>

<p>The books for the most part bore on one subject—phrenology.
Nearly every known work treating
of it was included in the collection. There were
the early writings of Dr. Franz Joseph Gall and
his pupil, Dr. Spurzheim; there were the discoveries
of George and Andrew Coombs and of Dr.
Elliotson, and the lectures of that earliest and
ablest of American phrenologists, Dr. Charles
Caldwell, and of the later disciple, Fowler. All of
these bore many annotations, marked paragraphs,
underlined sentences and marginal comments.
Here and there were inserted pages of closely
written manuscript, recording the results of
Schlippenbach’s personal observation—cases that
had come under his notice and to which he had
given infinite study. From these it was very soon
made apparent to Grey that the late Herr Doctor
had ideas distinctively his own. While he accepted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
many of the conclusions of the earlier apostles
of the creed he went a step further, and believed
that character could be formed and developed
by the systematic physical building up of
certain portions of the mental structure and the
depression of other portions. This, he claimed,
was best accomplished by magnetic stimulation
and absorption. Positive magnetic currents stimulated
and nourished, while negative currents degenerated
and destroyed.</p>

<p>He had conceived this theory, his writings
made clear, while tutor at the Budavian Court,
and had presumed to experiment on the infant
Crown Prince. At that time he had kept a journal
in which he made entry, briefly and roughly,
not only of his scientific accomplishments, but of
incidents bearing in any way on his career. This
journal was secured by a lock, but Minna and her
sister not merely consented to its breaking, but
insisted upon it. And here was found the long
and well-kept secret of the writer’s quarrel with
Queen Anna and the abduction of the young heir
apparent. Her Majesty having been informed of
the tutor’s novel methods of mental development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
had commanded their cessation so far as her infant
son was concerned; and the tutor’s departure
from the Court was only a part of the outcome.
The journal revealed the fact—though it was not
stated in so many words, and to those unfamiliar
with Budavian history the entries might have
meant nothing—that the tutor was, if not personally
the abductor of the young sprig of royalty,
certainly an important factor in the abduction, his
object being not so much to avenge himself on
Queen Anna as to gather the results of the experiments
he had been engaged in from the child’s
earliest infancy. There was no direct mention,
either, of the little fellow’s death, but the absence
after a few months of entries concerning him was
good ground for the belief that he did not long
survive his arrival in America.</p>

<p>Package after package of letters from Professor
Trent showed that from the time of Schlippenbach’s
emigration up to almost the immediate
present he had been in correspondence with the
head of the University of Kürschdorf. In view of
what Count von Ritter had told him, the more
recent of these letters were to Grey of paramount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
interest, and he read them with careful attention,
and especially one in which appeared the following
paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can fancy the surprise, not unmixed with joy, with
which I read your letter of the twenty-fifth of August.
The fact that the heir to our throne is still alive and
where you can lay your hands upon him seems a wonderful
dispensation of an all-wise Providence; for in the
event of His Majesty’s death—and he has been for two
years a terrible sufferer from an incurable ailment—the
crown must otherwise go, as you know, to that prince of
scapegraces, Hugo. I have given your communication to
the Chancellor, and you will doubtless hear from him in
the near future. Fancy our future King, all unmindful,
serving in the capacity of a valet! Truth is indeed
stranger than fiction.</p></blockquote>

<p>Subsequent letters gave hints here and there of
the progress of the investigation, which, it seemed,
was conducted with no little secrecy. From these
it appeared that Schlippenbach had had many interviews
with the Budavian Minister at Washington
and the Budavian Consul at New York, but
that the person of the pretended Crown Prince was
not revealed to them until some time in March, by
which date, or, in fact, as early as January, he had
become a member of Schlippenbach’s household
in Avenue A. Of his removal from where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
was supposed to have been in service to the home
of the old Herr Doctor, Professor Trent wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And you have not told him yet, you say, of the honours
that are his. All through this I can see the Divine Hand.
The embezzlement and disappearance of his employer offered
just the opportunity you desired to have him with
you. You can now, by degrees, fit him—gradually prepare
him, I mean—for the high estate which is his inheritance;
whereas had he continued in his employment such a
procedure would have been hedged around with difficulties.
I am glad you set me right in the matter of names.
I knew that he had gone by the name of Lutz; and I could
not understand who this other Lutz was. You say he is
his foster-brother, the son of the woman who reared him.
I think it wise to have him take another name for the
journey over here; and your idea of having him pose as
your nephew, Arndt, is capital, provided, of course, there
is none of your nephews’ friends or acquaintances coming
on the same steamer.</p></blockquote>

<p>The insight which these letters gave to Grey
only served to whet his appetite for additional detail.
Many of the revelations were startling, some
of them in a way amusing, yet the general impression
they made was not of the cleverness of
the schemers but rather of their want of skill, their
rash indiscretion, their apparently laboured complication
of things, which by very reason of the
resultant network offered unnecessary loopholes
for discovery and frustration. In this he found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
proof of Schlippenbach’s lack of balance, which
he was charitable enough to consider the result
of mental derangement. He was not so much
a knave, he told himself, as he was a maniac.</p>

<p>From Kürschdorf the news had come to him
that the King was going to die. He remembered
then, possibly with a stricken conscience, that he
was partly if not wholly responsible for the fact
that His Majesty would leave no son to succeed
him. If at this juncture he were able to produce
the heir, what might he not expect in the way of
honours? But the Crown Prince was dead and
therefore not producible.</p>

<p>Grey could read very clearly between the lines
of the story as it was opened up to him, and he
perceived the birth just here of the temptation to
produce the heir to the throne by constructing a
replica of the deceased Maximilian. Had he been
going about such a business himself, he would
probably have chosen some conscienceless fellow
to personify the departed one. But with Schlippenbach
his science was always pre-eminent. As,
years before, he had endeavoured by means of this
to build up from the real infant heir a prince that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
should meet his views of what a prince should be,
so now he chose to make, from a young man possessed
of certain fitting physical and mental attributes,
a prince to order.</p>

<p>The raw material must be tall, erect and of dignified
bearing, of intelligence and education. The
Crown Prince had been dark-eyed, but flaxen-haired.
To secure this latter natural combination
was not easy. But while his knowledge of chemicals
left him powerless to change blue eyes to
brown, his familiarity with the potency of peroxide
of hydrogen made it quite possible for
him to change black hair to blond. And so
he set about finding a gentleman of the desired
type. Daily he must have passed hundreds
on the street, but seeing them and getting
them within the radius of his ministration
were two different things. In his circle
of acquaintances he knew of no one that
would answer. But from one of his acquaintances,
Lutz, the valet, he had heard much of the
valet’s employer, and the valet’s employer evidently
seemed to him to be very nearly what he
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
All this Grey gathered by the very simple process
of logical reasoning from what he found in
Herr Schlippenbach’s books and papers. But
there was much still which by no method of inference
could he satisfactorily explain.</p>

<p>In the examination of the contents of the boxes
Minna was deeply interested, and with her Grey
discussed each and every significant paragraph
and passage. They were still busy exchanging
views when, towards five o’clock in the afternoon,
the sound of carriage wheels on the driveway below
drew the Fraülein to the open window.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” she cried, joyously, “it’s Miss Van
Tuyl and Mr. O’Hara and another gentleman.
Come, we’ll go down and meet them.”</p>

<p>But Grey was not altogether pleased. In his
note to Hope he had warned her that it would not
be safe for her or anyone to visit or communicate
with him until events shaped themselves one way
or another. It being known that she and O’Hara
had come to Kürschdorf with him they would
probably be watched with a view to discovering
his whereabouts. Seeing that he had sent this
caution it was, he thought, most inconsiderate of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
them to disregard it. But he got up from his seat
on the floor and went downstairs with Minna,
nevertheless; and in spite of his momentary annoyance
there was only gladness in his eyes when
they fell upon the brown-eyed, white-clad girl in
the victoria, whose face was radiant with the joy
of seeing him again and the good news that she
was bringing. For she had not disobeyed, after
all. Events had already shaped themselves, as
her father’s little speech—once introductions were
over and they were all seated in the big square
living-room—very definitely proved.</p>

<p>“I’m more than glad to see you, Carey, my
boy,” Nicholas Van Tuyl had exclaimed, gripping
Grey’s hand with a cordiality that was stimulating,
“I’m delighted; and I’m happy to be the one
to bring you the best news you have had in a long
while.” This had been said outside, and it had
filled Grey with delicious expectancy. What followed,
however, was even better than he imagined.</p>

<p>“Not an hour ago,” began the New York
banker, “I had a call from your friend, Chancellor
von Ritter. I know him, met him in Munich
years ago, and went to him last night to get the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
truth about your imprisonment. He wouldn’t tell
me anything then, but I told him enough, it seems,
to upset the whole Privy Council and put a scapegrace
on the throne of Budavia. However, that’s
only by way of introduction. This afternoon he
called on me at the hotel, and told me a good many
things that the great and glorious Budavian public
will never know. He told me, for instance,
how the Government had been fooled and how
now it was going to get out of its predicament
with as good a grace as possible. He told me all
about your escape last night, and how you had
done the very thing that he could have most
wished. One of the problems that confronted him
was how to get rid of you without revealing the
Government’s error. Now that you have taken
the matter in your own hands, that question is
answered. All he hopes is that they’ll never be
able to find you; and they won’t—because they
are going to shut their eyes and not look.”</p>

<p>Grey laughed, and the rest of the party
joined in.</p>

<p>“This diplomacy reminds me of a French
farce,” remarked O’Hara. “The actors who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
really know it all better than anyone else are apparently
the only ones who cannot see what is
perfectly palpable to the audience.”</p>

<p>“If I were you,” Van Tuyl continued, “I’d
shave off that beard and moustache at once; that
will make their dissembling appear a little bit real.
And then I’d get out of town just as soon as I
could make it convenient. Not that there would
be any danger from the Government as it now
stands, but with Hugo and his followers in command
you can’t tell what might happen overnight.”</p>

<p>Grey nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, smiling, “I think you’re
right. I won’t stop for the royal obsequies. It
may seem disrespectful to my late sire, but now
that I have my wings back I feel like using them.”</p>

<p>“I never did care much for funerals,” added
Nicholas Van Tuyl, “and so Hope and I will go
with you.”</p>

<p>O’Hara’s eyes were fixed on Minna, who was
gazing pensively at the white-scrubbed floor.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll stop,” he said, a little seriously.
“You won’t need me, Grey, and I’d like to look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
over the Budavian military, which will be out in
force.”</p>

<p>The Fraülein’s gaze was lifted and her eyes
for an instant met those of the Irish lieutenant.
In them he read the answer he craved to the question
his heart was asking.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Grey</span> had set apart the books and
papers that had to do either directly
or indirectly with his case, because
he saw in them a circumstantial defence
to the charges which were still hanging
over him at home. To his use of them
for this purpose Minna and her sister gladly consented,
and so when that evening, after having
been cropped and clean-shaven by Johann, he bade
the little household good-bye and was driven into
town to the Grand Hotel Königin Anna, he
carried this evidence with him.</p>

<p>It was, as has been observed, a day rife with
revelations. The discoveries of its daylight hours
were of incalculable value, but the disclosures reserved
for the night were of even more consequence.
The train that afternoon had brought
from Paris a large company of visitors intent
upon viewing the pomp and panoply of a royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
funeral, and among them were the remaining
members of that gay little dinner party at Armenonville
the week before.</p>

<p>The Van Tuyls ran into them at the hotel on
their return from the Fahler farm, and Hope immediately
had an inspiration.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give a dinner tonight,” she said,
“just the most informal sort of a dinner in our
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>. And I want you all to come. It doesn’t
make any difference whether you have your trunks
or not. You are not expected to dress. I’m going
to treat you to a surprise.”</p>

<p>The women were all curiosity on the instant
and showed it. The men accepted politely, but declared
that the hostess was attraction sufficient.</p>

<p>Hope had made the proposition on impulse, and
it was too late to draw back when she caught her
father’s disapproving eye.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure,” he commented, once they
were alone, “that this thing is wise. Carey isn’t
yet out of the woods, and the story of his alleged
embezzlement and all that is too fresh to have
been forgotten. Explanations at a dinner party
aren’t pleasant things. We know he is innocent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
but you don’t want to put him on trial before a
jury of your guests.”</p>

<p>But Hope was staunch in her loyalty.</p>

<p>“Our verdict will be sufficient,” she answered,
bravely. “If I had stopped to think of all you
say I probably shouldn’t have asked them, but as
it is I’m glad I did it. It clears the situation at
once. They must know from my having promised
to be his wife and your having given your consent,
that he is innocent.”</p>

<p>Nicholas Van Tuyl shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he replied, a little doubtfully, “perhaps;
but, my dear girl, don’t hint at the Prince
business. The Fahlers will keep their mouths
closed for the sake of their dead relative, but no
injunction of secrecy would still the tongues of
Mrs. Dickie and Lady Constance.”</p>

<p>Hope demurred.</p>

<p>“It’s such an interesting story,” she protested,
“and I am a woman!”</p>

<p>“But the Government here does not want it to
get out.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to know what we owe to the
Government,” the girl inquired. “I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
to be disobedient, father dear, but I can’t promise
to control myself under provocation.”</p>

<p>Again Mr. Van Tuyl shrugged his shoulders.
His daughter was his idol and he was as yarn in
her hands.</p>

<p>When Grey arrived and was told of the plan,
he received the tidings somewhat ruefully. He
complained that his trunks were still at the Residenz
Schloss, and that, in the torn and bedraggled
raiment he was wearing, to pose as the object of
interest at a dinner party, no matter how informal,
was apt to be a little trying, to say the
least. But O’Hara, who had driven into town
with him, came to the rescue. He and Grey were
very nearly of a size, and as he was the fortunate
possessor of two evening suits he promptly placed
one of them at Grey’s disposal.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this satisfactory overcoming
of a grave difficulty, Grey was not present
when the party sat down to dinner; for, as he was
about to join the company, Nicholas Van Tuyl
broke in upon him, carrying in his hand a note
which had just been delivered by an orderly from
the Royal Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
“You’ll have to go, won’t you?” he asked, as
Grey ran his eye over the page.</p>

<p>It was from Chancellor von Ritter and was addressed
to the banker.</p>

<p>“If you are in communication with Mr. Grey,”
it read, “send him here with all speed. The man
Lutz can last only a few hours. He is anxious to
make an ante-mortem statement, but insists
that Mr. Grey shall be present when he makes
it.”</p>

<p>And so Grey rushed off in a cab, and as the
dinner party took their places at table in the Van
Tuyl <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, he was climbing the Royal Hospital
stairs to the little white room in which lay dying
the young man who had served him faithfully for
over two years as valet, only to fall by reason of
avarice into the rôle of villain in his life’s melodrama.</p>

<p>The eyes that looked up at him from dark,
cavernous depths in a face pale as chalk had in
them an appeal that touched a chord of his sympathy,
and for the moment he forgot the injuries
he had suffered and remembered only the services
he had experienced at those hands, which lay limp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
and waxen-yellow against the spotless white of
the coverlet.</p>

<p>The small room was somewhat crowded. Chancellor
von Ritter was there with a notary and a
stenographer; near the window stood a soldier,
whose very presence seemed an irony, which he
appeared to recognise in retiring as far as the
limits of the tiny chamber would permit; and
there, too, of course, was the inevitable nun-like
nurse in significantly immaculate muslin and the
great flaring headdress of her sisterhood.</p>

<p>“He seems a little stronger at the moment,”
whispered the Chancellor; “you came at an opportune
time. He has been asking for you all the
afternoon.”</p>

<p>The nurse was moistening the sufferer’s lips.
When she finished, Grey spoke to him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to see you here, Lutz,” he said,
simply.</p>

<p>His breathing, he noticed, was very short and
laboured.</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you for coming, sir,” he replied,
and his voice was stronger than one would
have expected. “I’ve got a lot to tell you; but it’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
so late now I don’t know whether I’ll be able.”
He paused between his sentences in an effort to
husband his waning strength. “I was a good
enough fellow once, Mr. Grey, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>Grey nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, with sincerity, “you were
all right, Lutz.”</p>

<p>“I never really meant you any harm, sir,” he
went on. “It seemed to me that it would be a
good thing for you.”</p>

<p>The Chancellor motioned to the stenographer,
who drew his chair closer to the bedside and took
a note-book and pencil from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Afterwards,” Lutz continued, “after Dr.
Schlippenbach died and I knew we couldn’t keep
you under the spell any more, I got frightened;
and then I drank a good deal, and I—yes, I was
crazy at times. Absinthe, Mr. Grey. I wasn’t
used to it, and it turned my head. I thought to
save myself I must get rid of you. I tried to
smother you with gas that night last week in
Paris. Captain Lindenwald knew of it. He was
afraid of you, too. He said suspicion would fall
on Baron von Einhard; that we would never be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
suspected. And when I failed he went to Baron
von Einhard and—how much he got I don’t
know; but the Baron paid him to go away and
leave you, agreeing that he would put you where
you would never be heard of again. Then we
came here, with a story about your being mad and
being locked up in a Paris sanitarium. It was
the only thing we could do. If the plan had
worked we should have been in trouble for a while,
maybe, but when Prince Hugo came to the throne
we should have been rewarded. I sold the Baron
the strong-box with all those manufactured proofs
of your right to the crown; and I told him you
had the Prince of Kronfeld ring. I’m sorry, sir,
I’m sorry. But I’m a coward, and I was in terror
and more than half insane with that green stuff.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” Grey interjected. “But
tell me, Lutz, how this whole thing started, back
in New York. Tell me about Schlippenbach and
how you and he managed it together.”</p>

<p>The nurse, from her place by the pillow, leaned
over and wiped her patient’s brow. Then she
moistened his lips again, and his deep-sunken eyes
looked his appreciation. For some minutes he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
was silent, endeavouring apparently by an effort
of will to gather fresh energy; and to Grey’s mind
recurred the picture of that darkened room in
Paris, just six days ago, with the dying Herr
Schlippenbach struggling to make himself understood.</p>

<p>“He was more devil than man,” Lutz resumed.
“He was always working with strange drugs and
experimenting with batteries on cats and dogs,
and children, too. One day he asked me a great
many questions about you, Mr. Grey, and then he
asked me if I’d like to be rich—very rich, he said.
‘Everyone wants to be rich,’ I answered. ‘If
you’ll do just as I tell you,’ he said, ‘you’ll have
more money than you ever dreamed of.’ He told
me he wanted me to put just one tiny pellet in your
coffee each morning. It would not harm you, he
said, but you would doze off for just ten minutes
after you had taken it, and you would never know
you had been dozing. ‘And while he is asleep,’
he said, ‘you can tell him to do anything you wish
at any time in that day and he will do it. Tell
him, for instance,’ he advised me, ‘to double your
wages when he returns from his office in the evening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and he will do it.’ I laughed at the idea and
had no faith in it; but I consented to try it. And
it worked. You did double my wages, Mr. Grey,
just as I asked you to, and you never knew I
had asked you. Each day I gave you the pellet,
as he directed, and each day I suggested that you
do certain things at certain hours, and you always
did them.”</p>

<p>“Hypnotic suggestion,” commented Grey, involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Something like it,” Lutz replied, “but he said
it was not. At least, only in part. The pellet was
the principal thing. He made the pellets himself.
They were his secret. I gave you the last the day
before he died; and I knew then that I could control
you no more.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Grey urged, “but after the first, what
happened? After I raised your wages, what other
things did you suggest?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of importance for a month or two.
Just trifles—that you come home early and tell
me you would not require me that night; or that
you would give me a coat I wanted very much,
and things of that sort. But one day Schlippenbach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
came to the rooms while you were down
town. ‘Tomorrow morning,’ he said,’I am coming
here early, before Mr. Grey is up. You must
hide me somewhere until you have given him the
pellet.’ He came and I hid him in your wardrobe;
but when you had had your coffee with his
drug in it he came out, and then I saw for the first
time the power of this thing. He directed you
very minutely and very exactly. Every minute in
the day you were under his commands. You were
to secure a hundred thousand dollars in cash and
you were to bring it to his house on Avenue A at
four o’clock in the afternoon. And at this house
you were to remain. That evening I went there,
and there you were. You did not know me. Your
name had been changed to Arndt. I called you
Mr. Grey to test the thing, and you appeared to
think I was crazy. Schlippenbach told me you had
brought the money. You never left his house until
we sailed for this country.”</p>

<p>“What did I do there?”</p>

<p>“You did very little, but Schlippenbach did a
great deal. Each day he had his batteries working
on your head. He told me he was building<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
up your self-esteem and that he was depleting
your reverence. He was developing those cerebral
organs which he thought would fit you for a
throne and reducing those which he thought would
unfit you. He said that in this way he could
change you completely. After a few years of constant
treatment, three or four years at most, you
would, he told me, be no more Mr. Grey, the New
York broker, than I would. You would be the
King of Budavia and never know that you had not
been born to it. And then there would be no further
need of pellets or of galvanism. The transformation
would have been accomplished.”</p>

<p>The dying man, becoming more and more interested
in his subject, was speaking in clearer
tones and with much less effort; and his auditors
listened, spellbound, to his exposition of the marvellous
methods of his mountebank master.</p>

<p>“And as the days went on it was wonderful
how you did change, sir. You spoke differently
and you acted differently. He made you grow a
beard and moustache, which he bleached without
your knowledge, as he did your hair, and your
most intimate friend wouldn’t have recognised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
you, Mr. Grey. I don’t believe your mother
would have known you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And the money?” Grey queried, fearing that
in his enthusiasm Lutz would overtax his strength
and leave this most important point uncovered.
“What did Schlippenbach do with the hundred
thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“A good deal of it was spent,” the valet answered,
“but some of it is still in the East River
National Bank, and some with Graeff &amp; Welbrock,
the German bankers. When we came away we
brought with us two letters of credit, one in his
name and one in yours, for twenty thousand dollars
each.”</p>

<p>Of these facts Grey made a mental note.</p>

<p>“Some of it you will get back, sir,” Lutz
added, after a pause. “Perhaps most of it, for
the old man owns some property on the East Side,
and you can prove that he was responsible for the
theft. And now, Mr. Grey”—and something in
the nature of a smile flickered ghastly and distressful
about the corners of his livid mouth—“I
think I have told you all. But”—his yellow right
hand slid slowly a few inches over the coverlet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
towards its edge—“I have in return a favour to
ask. Maybe you’ll feel you can’t grant it. I’m
going pretty fast, I imagine. They say I won’t
last till daylight comes, and—I’d like, sir—if
you don’t mind too much”—his sentences were
very halt once more—“don’t mind too much——”</p>

<p>Grey leaned over and took the sliding hand in
his own.</p>

<p>“All right, Lutz,” he said, with a tremour in his
voice that he could not control, “all right, man.
I don’t believe you were half to blame. He had
you under a spell, too, I dare say. I forgive you
freely, and God bless you!”</p>

<p>The flickering, vagrant smile merged into an
expression of peace. Into the sunken eyes came
resignation.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir!” the grey lips murmured,
“thank you! thank you!”</p>

<p>The notary mumbled a form of oath to which
Lutz gave a voiceless assent. Then his lids fell,
and when Grey and Count von Ritter left the
room he was barely conscious.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a certified copy of the statement sent
to you Mr. Grey,” the Chancellor volunteered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
“In it you will have evidence that is beyond all
dispute. I congratulate you on securing such a
complete refutation of so baseless and yet so dangerous
a slander.”</p>

<h2><a id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> contrast between the tiny white
room in the hospital with the dire
shadow of the Grim Reaper hovering
over the narrow cot bed, and the
spacious, brilliant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> of the hotel, where life,
assertive, aggressive, almost obtrusive, was
dominant, had something of a dazzling effect
on Carey Grey, and he paused a moment on the
threshold, with blinking eyes, in an effort to adjust
his vision to the sudden change of scene.</p>

<p>There was a momentary lull in the merriment
that smote him as the door swung open in answer
to his knock, and then the cannonade of voices—of
cries of surprise, of welcoming greetings, of
laughter—was resumed, and Nicholas Van Tuyl
rose from his place at the round table, which, with
its snowy damask dotted with pink-shaded candles
and dappled with silver and crystal, seemed
like the centre of some giant flower of which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
men and women about it were the variegated
petals.</p>

<p>“My friends,” cried the host, raising his voice
and hand simultaneously for silence, “I have
pleasure in presenting to you my future son-in-law,
Mr. Carey Grey, of New York.”</p>

<p>The next instant everybody was shouting at
once. The men were up and bearing down on
the newcomer in a solid phalanx, and Lady Constance
and Mrs. Dickie were waving their napkins
and fairly shrieking their congratulations. When
at length something like order reigned again,
Frothingham found his champagne glass and proposed
a toast:</p>

<p>“To the bride-elect,” he cried. “‘She moves
a goddess and she looks a queen.’”</p>

<p>Grey’s response was brief but enthusiastic, and
the significance of the quotation with which he
closed it evoked an outburst of applause that
must have been heard as far as the Kursaal, two
blocks away.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king’s a beggar now the play is done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is well ended, if <em>this</em> suit be won.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
He did not know it at the time, but prior to his
coming the whole story of his adventure had been
related and discussed, much to the entertainment
of the party in general and to the intense edification
and delight of young Edson in particular,
who resolved to make to his chief, the Ambassador,
a full report of the extraordinary affair, with
a view to having it forwarded to Washington to be
filed among the State archives, as indicative of a
vulnerable point in Budavia’s boasted supremacy
in statecraft. The aptness of the quotation, therefore,
was more generally appreciated than Grey
had any notion it would be, and the hilarious approbation
of his auditors was consequently a good
deal of a surprise.</p>

<p>Nicholas Van Tuyl, however, leaned over in
the midst of the cheering, to tell him that the plot
of his play and the part he had enacted were
known to the company. The news was not ungrateful,
for from the moment of his entrance he
had felt a natural restraint, which was now relieved.
Very soon the matter came up again, and
he related his experience at the hospital, which
was listened to with the deepest interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
“Under the circumstances,” observed Sinclair
Edson when Grey had finished, “it is not surprising
that the extradition proceedings have been
withdrawn.”</p>

<p>“Withdrawn?” exclaimed Grey, in amazement.
“If it be true I should say it were most
surprising.”</p>

<p>“We had a cable to that effect yesterday before
I left Paris,” continued the secretary. “They
were withdrawn at the instance of your partner,
Mr. Mallory.”</p>

<p>“That is inexplicable,” Grey commented.
“He doesn’t know anything more now than he
did a week ago.”</p>

<p>Van Tuyl drained his wine-glass and wiped his
lips with his napkin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes he does, Carey,” he said, “he knows
pretty much about it. I took the liberty of cabling
to him all I knew. Besides, that whole business
was a mare’s nest. If you hadn’t disappeared
there would never have been any prosecution.
Any one knows that a partner can’t be held for
borrowing from his own firm, and unless I’m very
much mistaken you were in a position to turn over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
real estate worth several times the amount secured
on the bonds.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” Grey replied, smiling,
“but, strange as it may seem, that view of the situation
never occurred to me before.”</p>

<p>“The newspapers were responsible for most of
the hue and cry, I fancy,” Van Tuyl continued,
“and as for the extradition part, I imagine Mallory
took that step more from an impulse to find
out whether the cable you sent him was really
from you, and with the hope of locating you—dragging
you back from the grave, so to speak—than
with an idea of punishment for a crime that
was never really committed.”</p>

<p>A Dresden clock on the mantel-shelf had tinkled
midnight before the party broke up, agreeing to be
down for an early breakfast at a quarter of eight,
since the Van Tuyls and Grey were leaving
Kürschdorf at nine, to connect with the Orient
Express at Munich.</p>

<p>When the rest had gone, Grey, who had lingered,
drew Hope out onto the balcony. The
music of the band which had floated up from
below throughout the evening had ceased, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
rushing Weisswasser and the breeze stirring the
foliage of the trees on the Quai combined in a
melody to which their hearts beat a joyous refrain.
The stars twinkled in unison in the blue-black
canopy of the heavens, and from the distance a
nightingale’s song made chorus.</p>

<p>“‘She moves a goddess and she looks a
queen,’” Grey repeated, his arm about the girl’s
supple waist. “That was an inspiration on Frothingham’s
part. The line was never more aptly
quoted. <em>My</em> goddess! <em>My</em> queen! Ah, my darling,
if I could only make you know the happiness
that is mine tonight!”</p>

<p>Her head was resting against his shoulder, but
now she turned her face to him and in her eyes
was a world of passionate adoration.</p>

<p>“I know,” she murmured, softly. “It is mine,
too, dear. It is a mutual happiness, and we both
know it. That is the reason it is so sweet.”</p>

<p>He drew her still closer, until he could feel her
heart beating against his side.</p>

<p>“God is good,” he said, reverently. “There
were moments in the past week when I saw only
the frowning face of an implacable fate; when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
felt that the net woven about me was too cruelly
strong ever to give way to my struggles; and then
I was more than half inclined to curse God and
die. But we are only blind children, as it has been
said, and when Providence is preparing for us the
most delectable morsels we grow rebellious because
we can’t see just how it is being done.”</p>

<p>“‘More welcome is the sweet,’” she quoted,
returning the pressure of his hand. “You will
never know, my very dear, the agony I suffered
in those weeks after your disappearance. I would
have died gladly—oh, so gladly; but, as you say,
God is good, only we cannot always see. The sky
was very black, without a single star, and the sun
would never rise again, never, never. I knew it.”</p>

<p>“But it has, love, hasn’t it?” Grey asked, cheerily.
“And we’ll pray now for a long, long, sunshiny
day to make up for so dark a night.”</p>

<p>Then he bent his head and kissed her; and the
nightingale’s song was a pæan, and the music of
the trees and the river a serenade.</p>

<p>After a little, Nicholas Van Tuyl joined them.</p>

<p>“Well, lad,” he said to Grey, as he flicked the
ashes from his cigar, “what are your plans?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
“I’m taking <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Savoie</i> from Havre on Saturday,”
the young man answered. “I’d rather lose
my right arm than leave Hope now, just as I have
found her, but there’s no getting out of it. I must
hurry back to New York and square things.”</p>

<p>“You must go so soon, dear?” she questioned,
with just a suspicion of a pout.</p>

<p>“I must,” he replied, reluctance in his voice.
“I’ll try to rejoin you later; but every duty demands
my presence in America now.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to stop, of course,” Van Tuyl observed;
and then he added, with a smile: “my
daughter, here, will be very busy, I fancy, for the
next few weeks with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couturières</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marchandes
de modes</i> in the rue de la Paix and thereabouts.
So don’t exercise yourself unnecessarily, Carey.
She’ll hardly have time to miss you. There’s no
salve in the world to a woman so effective as that
to be found in ordering new finery.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe him, dear,” the girl protested,
her fingers tightening on Grey’s hand. “I
shall think of you every minute I’m awake, and
dream of you every minute I’m asleep.”</p>

<p>The two men lounging against the iron railing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of the balcony smoked and chatted for a long time
after Hope went in. They had much in common,
and to each occurred a multiplicity of matters
of mutual interest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the street below grew quiet, the terrace
was deserted, the wind in the trees died to a
whisper, and the incessant murmur of the hurrying
waters accentuated rather than disturbed the
silence. But the two great lamps on either side
of the hotel’s broad entrance still blazed, throwing
a half circle of illumination out across the roadway
and in under the lindens of the Quai.</p>

<p>Grey, flinging away the end of his cigar, turned
and looked down, watching it fall and sputter red
sparks upon the macadam of the drive. And as
he looked a shadow glided swiftly across the arc
of light beneath the trees and was swallowed up
in the gloom beyond—a shadow, the contour of
which even in that brief moment struck Grey as
unmistakably familiar, recalling a figure that he
had seen twenty-four hours before, leaping wildly,
from dark to dark, down a winding stone stairway.</p>

<p>“It’s bed time,” said Nicholas Van Tuyl, yawning.
“You must be tired. Suppose we——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
A pistol shot, startlingly loud and sharp against
the night silence, clipped off the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke, and the stillness
was the stillness of death. Then came the patter
of hurrying steps, and presently voices were heard
and men were darting across the street from all
directions, and all heading toward the Quai at a
point just opposite the balcony.</p>

<p>“Murder?” suggested Van Tuyl.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Grey, with conviction.
“Suicide.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, as they watched and listened,
the crowd came straggling back, two by
two and in groups, all chattering.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” said one. The words rose distinctly
audible.</p>

<p>“He made very sure,” commented another.</p>

<p>“Fancy blowing out his brains on the edge of
the Quai and burying himself in the river!” exclaimed
a third.</p>

<p>“For love, I suppose,” a young man ventured.</p>

<p>“Lost his last mark at the Kursaal tonight
probably,” an older man theorised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Grey and Van Tuyl turned into the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>
through the open window.</p>

<p>“That is what is called retribution,” said the
younger man, “but it is usually longer delayed.”</p>

<p>Van Tuyl’s face asked for enlightenment.</p>

<p>“I could hardly have been mistaken,” Grey answered,
with assurance. “I saw the fellow just a
moment before. It was Captain Lindenwald, of
the Royal Household and Equerry to the late
King Frederic of Budavia.”</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
